            "tf.Tensor(b'The Doctrine of the Mean\\nBy Confucius\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Heaven has conferred is called The Nature; an accordance with\\nthis nature is called The Path of duty; the regulation of this path\\nis called Instruction. \\n\\nThe path may not be left for an instant. If it could be left, it would\\nnot be the path. On this account, the superior man does not wait till\\nhe sees things, to be cautious, nor till he hears things, to be apprehensive.\\n\\nThere is nothing more visible than what is secret, and nothing more\\nmanifest than what is minute. Therefore the superior man is watchful\\nover himself, when he is alone. \\n\\nWhile there are no stirrings of pleasure, anger, sorrow, or joy, the\\nmind may be said to be in the state of Equilibrium. When those feelings\\nhave been stirred, and they act in their due degree, there ensues\\nwhat may be called the state of Harmony. This Equilibrium is the great\\nroot from which grow all the human actings in the world, and this\\nHarmony is the universal path which they all should pursue.\\n\\nLet the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection, and\\na happy order will prevail throughout heaven and earth, and all things\\nwill be nourished and flourish. \\n\\nChung-ni said, \"The superior man embodies the course of the Mean;\\nthe mean man acts contrary to the course of the Mean. \\n\\n\"The superior man\\'s embodying the course of the Mean is because he\\nis a superior man, and so always maintains the Mean. The mean man\\'s\\nacting contrary to the course of the Mean is because he is a mean\\nman, and has no caution.\" \\n\\nThe Master said, \"Perfect is the virtue which is according to the\\nMean! Rare have they long been among the people, who could practice\\nit! \\n\\nThe Master said, \"I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not\\nwalked in:-The knowing go beyond it, and the stupid do not come up\\nto it. I know how it is that the path of the Mean is not understood:-The\\nmen of talents and virtue go beyond it, and the worthless do not come\\nup to it. \\n\\n\"There is no body but eats and drinks. But they are few who can distinguish\\nflavors.\" \\n\\nThe Master said, \"Alas! How is the path of the Mean untrodden!\"\\n\\nThe Master said, \"There was Shun:-He indeed was greatly wise! Shun\\nloved to question others, and to study their words, though they might\\nbe shallow. He concealed what was bad in them and displayed what was\\ngood. He took hold of their two extremes, determined the Mean, and\\nemployed it in his government of the people. It was by this that he\\nwas Shun!\" \\n\\nThe Master said \"Men all say, \\'We are wise\\'; but being driven forward\\nand taken in a net, a trap, or a pitfall, they know not how to escape.\\nMen all say, \\'We are wise\\'; but happening to choose the course of\\nthe Mean, they are not able to keep it for a round month.\"\\n\\nThe Master said \"This was the manner of Hui:-he made choice of the\\nMean, and whenever he got hold of what was good, he clasped it firmly,\\nas if wearing it on his breast, and did not lose it.\" \\n\\nThe Master said, \"The kingdom, its states, and its families, may be\\nperfectly ruled; dignities and emoluments may be declined; naked weapons\\nmay be trampled under the feet; but the course of the Mean cannot\\nbe attained to.\" \\n\\nTsze-lu asked about energy. \\nThe Master said, \"Do you mean the energy of the South, the energy\\nof the North, or the energy which you should cultivate yourself?\\n\\n\"To show forbearance and gentleness in teaching others; and not to\\nrevenge unreasonable conduct:-this is the energy of southern regions,\\nand the good man makes it his study. \\n\\n\"To lie under arms; and meet death without regret:-this is the energy\\nof northern regions, and the forceful make it their study.\\n\\n\"Therefore, the superior man cultivates a friendly harmony, without\\nbeing weak.-How firm is he in his energy! He stands erect in the middle,\\nwithout inclining to either side.-How firm is he in his energy! When\\ngood principles prevail in the government of his country, he does\\nnot change from what he was in retirement. How firm is he in his energy!\\nWhen bad principles prevail in the country, he maintains his course\\nto death without changing.-How firm is he in his energy!\"\\n\\nThe Master said, \"To live in obscurity, and yet practice wonders,\\nin order to be mentioned with honor in future ages:-this is what I\\ndo not do. \\n\\n\"The good man tries to proceed according to the right path, but when\\nhe has gone halfway, he abandons it:-I am not able so to stop.\\n\\n\"The superior man accords with the course of the Mean. Though he may\\nbe all unknown, unregarded by the world, he feels no regret.-It is\\nonly the sage who is able for this.\" \\n\\nThe way which the superior man pursues, reaches wide and far, and\\nyet is secret. \\n\\nCommon men and women, however ignorant, may intermeddle with the knowledge\\nof it; yet in its utmost reaches, there is that which even the sage\\ndoes not know. Common men and women, however much below the ordinary\\nstandard of character, can carry it into practice; yet in its utmost\\nreaches, there is that which even the sage is not able to carry into\\npractice. Great as heaven and earth are, men still find some things\\nin them with which to be dissatisfied. Thus it is that, were the superior\\nman to speak of his way in all its greatness, nothing in the world\\nwould be found able to embrace it, and were he to speak of it in its\\nminuteness, nothing in the world would be found able to split it.\\n\\nIt is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The hawk flies up to heaven; the\\nfishes leap in the deep.\" This expresses how this way is seen above\\nand below. \\n\\nThe way of the superior man may be found, in its simple elements,\\nin the intercourse of common men and women; but in its utmost reaches,\\nit shines brightly through Heaven and earth. \\n\\nThe Master said \"The path is not far from man. When men try to pursue\\na course, which is far from the common indications of consciousness,\\nthis course cannot be considered The Path. \\n\\n\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \\'In hewing an ax handle, in hewing\\nan ax handle, the pattern is not far off. We grasp one ax handle to\\nhew the other; and yet, if we look askance from the one to the other,\\nwe may consider them as apart. Therefore, the superior man governs\\nmen, according to their nature, with what is proper to them, and as\\nsoon as they change what is wrong, he stops. \\n\\n\"When one cultivates to the utmost the principles of his nature, and\\nexercises them on the principle of reciprocity, he is not far from\\nthe path. What you do not like when done to yourself, do not do to\\nothers. \\n\\n\"In the way of the superior man there are four things, to not one\\nof which have I as yet attained.-To serve my father, as I would require\\nmy son to serve me: to this I have not attained; to serve my prince\\nas I would require my minister to serve me: to this I have not attained;\\nto serve my elder brother as I would require my younger brother to\\nserve me: to this I have not attained; to set the example in behaving\\nto a friend, as I would require him to behave to me: to this I have\\nnot attained. Earnest in practicing the ordinary virtues, and careful\\nin speaking about them, if, in his practice, he has anything defective,\\nthe superior man dares not but exert himself; and if, in his words,\\nhe has any excess, he dares not allow himself such license. Thus his\\nwords have respect to his actions, and his actions have respect to\\nhis words; is it not just an entire sincerity which marks the superior\\nman?\" \\n\\nThe superior man does what is proper to the station in which he is;\\nhe does not desire to go beyond this. \\n\\nIn a position of wealth and honor, he does what is proper to a position\\nof wealth and honor. In a poor and low position, he does what is proper\\nto a poor and low position. Situated among barbarous tribes, he does\\nwhat is proper to a situation among barbarous tribes. In a position\\nof sorrow and difficulty, he does what is proper to a position of\\nsorrow and difficulty. The superior man can find himself in no situation\\nin which he is not himself. \\n\\nIn a high situation, he does not treat with contempt his inferiors.\\nIn a low situation, he does not court the favor of his superiors.\\nHe rectifies himself, and seeks for nothing from others, so that he\\nhas no dissatisfactions. He does not murmur against Heaven, nor grumble\\nagainst men. \\n\\nThus it is that the superior man is quiet and calm, waiting for the\\nappointments of Heaven, while the mean man walks in dangerous paths,\\nlooking for lucky occurrences. \\n\\nThe Master said, \"In archery we have something like the way of the\\nsuperior man. When the archer misses the center of the target, he\\nturns round and seeks for the cause of his failure in himself.\"\\n\\nThe way of the superior man may be compared to what takes place in\\ntraveling, when to go to a distance we must first traverse the space\\nthat is near, and in ascending a height, when we must begin from the\\nlower ground. \\n\\nIt is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Happy union with wife and children\\nis like the music of lutes and harps. When there is concord among\\nbrethren, the harmony is delightful and enduring. Thus may you regulate\\nyour family, and enjoy the pleasure of your wife and children.\"\\n\\nThe Master said, \"In such a state of things, parents have entire complacence!\"\\n\\nThe Master said, \"How abundantly do spiritual beings display the powers\\nthat belong to them! \\n\\n\"We look for them, but do not see them; we listen to, but do not hear\\nthem; yet they enter into all things, and there is nothing without\\nthem. \\n\\n\"They cause all the people in the kingdom to fast and purify themselves,\\nand array themselves in their richest dresses, in order to attend\\nat their sacrifices. Then, like overflowing water, they seem to be\\nover the heads, and on the right and left of their worshippers.\\n\\n\"It is said in the Book of Poetry, \\'The approaches of the spirits,\\nyou cannot sunrise; and can you treat them with indifference?\\'\\n\\n\"Such is the manifestness of what is minute! Such is the impossibility\\nof repressing the outgoings of sincerity!\" \\n\\nThe Master said, \"How greatly filial was Shun! His virtue was that\\nof a sage; his dignity was the throne; his riches were all within\\nthe four seas. He offered his sacrifices in his ancestral temple,\\nand his descendants preserved the sacrifices to himself.\\n\\n\"Therefore having such great virtue, it could not but be that he should\\nobtain the throne, that he should obtain those riches, that he should\\nobtain his fame, that he should attain to his long life.\\n\\n\"Thus it is that Heaven, in the production of things, is sure to be\\nbountiful to them, according to their qualities. Hence the tree that\\nis flourishing, it nourishes, while that which is ready to fall, it\\noverthrows. \\n\\n\"In the Book of Poetry, it is said, \\'The admirable amiable prince\\ndisplayed conspicuously his excelling virtue, adjusting his people,\\nand adjusting his officers. Therefore, he received from Heaven his\\nemoluments of dignity. It protected him, assisted him, decreed him\\nthe throne; sending from Heaven these favors, as it were repeatedly.\\'\\n\\n\"We may say therefore that he who is greatly virtuous will be sure\\nto receive the appointment of Heaven.\" \\n\\nThe Master said, \"It is only King Wan of whom it can be said that\\nhe had no cause for grief! His father was King Chi, and his son was\\nKing Wu. His father laid the foundations of his dignity, and his son\\ntransmitted it. \\n\\n\"King Wu continued the enterprise of King T\\'ai, King Chi, and King\\nWan. He once buckled on his armor, and got possession of the kingdom.\\nHe did not lose the distinguished personal reputation which he had\\nthroughout the kingdom. His dignity was the royal throne. His riches\\nwere the possession of all within the four seas. He offered his sacrifices\\nin his ancestral temple, and his descendants maintained the sacrifices\\nto himself. \\n\\n\"It was in his old age that King Wu received the appointment to the\\nthrone, and the duke of Chau completed the virtuous course of Wan\\nand Wu. He carried up the title of king to T\\'ai and Chi, and sacrificed\\nto all the former dukes above them with the royal ceremonies. And\\nthis rule he extended to the princes of the kingdom, the great officers,\\nthe scholars, and the common people. If the father were a great officer\\nand the son a scholar, then the burial was that due to a great officer,\\nand the sacrifice that due to a scholar. If the father were a scholar\\nand the son a great officer, then the burial was that due to a scholar,\\nand the sacrifice that due to a great officer. The one year\\'s mourning\\nwas made to extend only to the great officers, but the three years\\'\\nmourning extended to the Son of Heaven. In the mourning for a father\\nor mother, he allowed no difference between the noble and the mean.\\n\\nThe Master said, \"How far-extending was the filial piety of King Wu\\nand the duke of Chau! \\n\\n\"Now filial piety is seen in the skillful carrying out of the wishes\\nof our forefathers, and the skillful carrying forward of their undertakings.\\n\\n\"In spring and autumn, they repaired and beautified the temple halls\\nof their fathers, set forth their ancestral vessels, displayed their\\nvarious robes, and presented the offerings of the several seasons.\\n\\n\"By means of the ceremonies of the ancestral temple, they distinguished\\nthe royal kindred according to their order of descent. By ordering\\nthe parties present according to their rank, they distinguished the\\nmore noble and the less. By the arrangement of the services, they\\nmade a distinction of talents and worth. In the ceremony of general\\npledging, the inferiors presented the cup to their superiors, and\\nthus something was given the lowest to do. At the concluding feast,\\nplaces were given according to the hair, and thus was made the distinction\\nof years. \\n\\n\"They occupied the places of their forefathers, practiced their ceremonies,\\nand performed their music. They reverenced those whom they honored,\\nand loved those whom they regarded with affection. Thus they served\\nthe dead as they would have served them alive; they served the departed\\nas they would have served them had they been continued among them.\\n\\n\"By the ceremonies of the sacrifices to Heaven and Earth they served\\nGod, and by the ceremonies of the ancestral temple they sacrificed\\nto their ancestors. He who understands the ceremonies of the sacrifices\\nto Heaven and Earth, and the meaning of the several sacrifices to\\nancestors, would find the government of a kingdom as easy as to look\\ninto his palm!\" \\n\\nThe Duke Ai asked about government. \\nThe Master said, \"The government of Wan and Wu is displayed in the\\nrecords,-the tablets of wood and bamboo. Let there be the men and\\nthe government will flourish; but without the men, their government\\ndecays and ceases. \\n\\n\"With the right men the growth of government is rapid, just as vegetation\\nis rapid in the earth; and, moreover, their government might be called\\nan easily-growing rush. \\n\\n\"Therefore the administration of government lies in getting proper\\nmen. Such men are to be got by means of the ruler\\'s own character.\\nThat character is to be cultivated by his treading in the ways of\\nduty. And the treading those ways of duty is to be cultivated by the\\ncherishing of benevolence. \\n\\n\"Benevolence is the characteristic element of humanity, and the great\\nexercise of it is in loving relatives. Righteousness is the accordance\\nof actions with what is right, and the great exercise of it is in\\nhonoring the worthy. The decreasing measures of the love due to relatives,\\nand the steps in the honor due to the worthy, are produced by the\\nprinciple of propriety. \\n\\n\"When those in inferior situations do not possess the confidence of\\ntheir superiors, they cannot retain the government of the people.\\n\\n\"Hence the sovereign may not neglect the cultivation of his own character.\\nWishing to cultivate his character, he may not neglect to serve his\\nparents. In order to serve his parents, he may not neglect to acquire\\nknowledge of men. In order to know men, he may not dispense with a\\nknowledge of Heaven. \\n\\n\"The duties of universal obligation are five and the virtues wherewith\\nthey are practiced are three. The duties are those between sovereign\\nand minister, between father and son, between husband and wife, between\\nelder brother and younger, and those belonging to the intercourse\\nof friends. Those five are the duties of universal obligation. Knowledge,\\nmagnanimity, and energy, these three, are the virtues universally\\nbinding. And the means by which they carry the duties into practice\\nis singleness. \\n\\n\"Some are born with the knowledge of those duties; some know them\\nby study; and some acquire the knowledge after a painful feeling of\\ntheir ignorance. But the knowledge being possessed, it comes to the\\nsame thing. Some practice them with a natural ease; some from a desire\\nfor their advantages; and some by strenuous effort. But the achievement\\nbeing made, it comes to the same thing.\" \\n\\nThe Master said, \"To be fond of learning is to be near to knowledge.\\nTo practice with vigor is to be near to magnanimity. To possess the\\nfeeling of shame is to be near to energy. \\n\\n\"He who knows these three things knows how to cultivate his own character.\\nKnowing how to cultivate his own character, he knows how to govern\\nother men. Knowing how to govern other men, he knows how to govern\\nthe kingdom with all its states and families. \\n\\n\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families\\nhave nine standard rules to follow;-viz., the cultivation of their\\nown characters; the honoring of men of virtue and talents; affection\\ntowards their relatives; respect towards the great ministers; kind\\nand considerate treatment of the whole body of officers; dealing with\\nthe mass of the people as children; encouraging the resort of all\\nclasses of artisans; indulgent treatment of men from a distance; and\\nthe kindly cherishing of the princes of the states. \\n\\n\"By the ruler\\'s cultivation of his own character, the duties of universal\\nobligation are set forth. By honoring men of virtue and talents, he\\nis preserved from errors of judgment. By showing affection to his\\nrelatives, there is no grumbling nor resentment among his uncles and\\nbrethren. By respecting the great ministers, he is kept from errors\\nin the practice of government. By kind and considerate treatment of\\nthe whole body of officers, they are led to make the most grateful\\nreturn for his courtesies. By dealing with the mass of the people\\nas his children, they are led to exhort one another to what is good.\\nBy encouraging the resort of an classes of artisans, his resources\\nfor expenditure are rendered ample. By indulgent treatment of men\\nfrom a distance, they are brought to resort to him from all quarters.\\nAnd by kindly cherishing the princes of the states, the whole kingdom\\nis brought to revere him. \\n\\n\"Self-adjustment and purification, with careful regulation of his\\ndress, and the not making a movement contrary to the rules of propriety\\nthis is the way for a ruler to cultivate his person. Discarding slanderers,\\nand keeping himself from the seductions of beauty; making light of\\nriches, and giving honor to virtue-this is the way for him to encourage\\nmen of worth and talents. Giving them places of honor and large emolument.\\nand sharing with them in their likes and dislikes-this is the way\\nfor him to encourage his relatives to love him. Giving them numerous\\nofficers to discharge their orders and commissions:-this is the way\\nfor him to encourage the great ministers. According to them a generous\\nconfidence, and making their emoluments large:-this is the way to\\nencourage the body of officers. Employing them only at the proper\\ntimes, and making the imposts light:-this is the way to encourage\\nthe people. By daily examinations and monthly trials, and by making\\ntheir rations in accordance with their labors:-this is the way to\\nencourage the classes of artisans. To escort them on their departure\\nand meet them on their coming; to commend the good among them, and\\nshow compassion to the incompetent:-this is the way to treat indulgently\\nmen from a distance. To restore families whose line of succession\\nhas been broken, and to revive states that have been extinguished;\\nto reduce to order states that are in confusion, and support those\\nwhich are in peril; to have fixed times for their own reception at\\ncourt, and the reception of their envoys; to send them away after\\nliberal treatment, and welcome their coming with small contributions:-this\\nis the way to cherish the princes of the states. \\n\\n\"All who have the government of the kingdom with its states and families\\nhave the above nine standard rules. And the means by which they are\\ncarried into practice is singleness. \\n\\n\"In all things success depends on previous preparation, and without\\nsuch previous preparation there is sure to be failure. If what is\\nto be spoken be previously determined, there will be no stumbling.\\nIf affairs be previously determined, there will be no difficulty with\\nthem. If one\\'s actions have been previously determined, there will\\nbe no sorrow in connection with them. If principles of conduct have\\nbeen previously determined, the practice of them will be inexhaustible.\\n\\n\"When those in inferior situations do not obtain the confidence of\\nthe sovereign, they cannot succeed in governing the people. There\\nis a way to obtain the confidence of the sovereign;-if one is not\\ntrusted by his friends, he will not get the confidence of his sovereign.\\nThere is a way to being trusted by one\\'s friends;-if one is not obedient\\nto his parents, he will not be true to friends. There is a way to\\nbeing obedient to one\\'s parents;-if one, on turning his thoughts in\\nupon himself, finds a want of sincerity, he will not be obedient to\\nhis parents. There is a way to the attainment of sincerity in one\\'s\\nself; -if a man do not understand what is good, he will not attain\\nsincerity in himself. \\n\\n\"Sincerity is the way of Heaven. The attainment of sincerity is the\\nway of men. He who possesses sincerity is he who, without an effort,\\nhits what is right, and apprehends, without the exercise of thought;-he\\nis the sage who naturally and easily embodies the right way. He who\\nattains to sincerity is he who chooses what is good, and firmly holds\\nit fast. \\n\\n\"To this attainment there are requisite the extensive study of what\\nis good, accurate inquiry about it, careful reflection on it, the\\nclear discrimination of it, and the earnest practice of it.\\n\\n\"The superior man, while there is anything he has not studied, or\\nwhile in what he has studied there is anything he cannot understand,\\nWill not intermit his labor. While there is anything he has not inquired\\nabout, or anything in what he has inquired about which he does not\\nknow, he will not intermit his labor. While there is anything which\\nhe has not reflected on, or anything in what he has reflected on which\\nhe does not apprehend, he will not intermit his labor. While there\\nis anything which he has not discriminated or his discrimination is\\nnot clear, he will not intermit his labor. If there be anything which\\nhe has not practiced, or his practice fails in earnestness, he will\\nnot intermit his labor. If another man succeed by one effort, he will\\nuse a hundred efforts. If another man succeed by ten efforts, he will\\nuse a thousand. \\n\\n\"Let a man proceed in this way, and, though dull, he will surely become\\nintelligent; though weak, he will surely become strong.\"\\n\\nWhen we have intelligence resulting from sincerity, this condition\\nis to be ascribed to nature; when we have sincerity resulting from\\nintelligence, this condition is to be ascribed to instruction. But\\ngiven the sincerity, and there shall be the intelligence; given the\\nintelligence, and there shall be the sincerity. \\n\\nIt is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity that\\ncan exist under heaven, who can give its fun development to his nature.\\nAble to give its full development to his own nature, he can do the\\nsame to the nature of other men. Able to give its full development\\nto the nature of other men, he can give their full development to\\nthe natures of animals and things. Able to give their full development\\nto the natures of creatures and things, he can assist the transforming\\nand nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth. Able to assist the transforming\\nand nourishing powers of Heaven and Earth, he may with Heaven and\\nEarth form a ternion. \\n\\nNext to the above is he who cultivates to the utmost the shoots of\\ngoodness in him. From those he can attain to the possession of sincerity.\\nThis sincerity becomes apparent. From being apparent, it becomes manifest.\\nFrom being manifest, it becomes brilliant. Brilliant, it affects others.\\nAffecting others, they are changed by it. Changed by it, they are\\ntransformed. It is only he who is possessed of the most complete sincerity\\nthat can exist under heaven, who can transform. \\n\\nIt is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to foreknow.\\nWhen a nation or family is about to flourish, there are sure to be\\nhappy omens; and when it is about to perish, there are sure to be\\nunlucky omens. Such events are seen in the milfoil and tortoise, and\\naffect the movements of the four limbs. When calamity or happiness\\nis about to come, the good shall certainly be foreknown by him, and\\nthe evil also. Therefore the individual possessed of the most complete\\nsincerity is like a spirit. \\n\\nSincerity is that whereby self-completion is effected, and its way\\nis that by which man must direct himself. \\n\\nSincerity is the end and beginning of things; without sincerity there\\nwould be nothing. On this account, the superior man regards the attainment\\nof sincerity as the most excellent thing. \\n\\nThe possessor of sincerity does not merely accomplish the self-completion\\nof himself. With this quality he completes other men and things also.\\nThe completing himself shows his perfect virtue. The completing other\\nmen and things shows his knowledge. But these are virtues belonging\\nto the nature, and this is the way by which a union is effected of\\nthe external and internal. Therefore, whenever he-the entirely sincere\\nman-employs them,-that is, these virtues, their action will be right.\\n\\nHence to entire sincerity there belongs ceaselessness. \\nNot ceasing, it continues long. Continuing long, it evidences itself.\\n\\nEvidencing itself, it reaches far. Reaching far, it becomes large\\nand substantial. Large and substantial, it becomes high and brilliant.\\n\\nLarge and substantial;-this is how it contains all things. High and\\nbrilliant;-this is how it overspreads all things. Reaching far and\\ncontinuing long;-this is how it perfects all things. \\n\\nSo large and substantial, the individual possessing it is the co-equal\\nof Earth. So high and brilliant, it makes him the co-equal of Heaven.\\nSo far-reaching and long-continuing, it makes him infinite.\\n\\nSuch being its nature, without any display, it becomes manifested;\\nwithout any movement, it produces changes; and without any effort,\\nit accomplishes its ends. \\n\\nThe way of Heaven and Earth may be completely declared in one sentence.-They\\nare without any doubleness, and so they produce things in a manner\\nthat is unfathomable. \\n\\nThe way of Heaven and Earth is large and substantial, high and brilliant,\\nfar-reaching and long-enduring. \\n\\nThe Heaven now before us is only this bright shining spot; but when\\nviewed in its inexhaustible extent, the sun, moon, stars, and constellations\\nof the zodiac, are suspended in it, and all things are overspread\\nby it. The earth before us is but a handful of soil; but when regarded\\nin its breadth and thickness, it sustains mountains like the Hwa and\\nthe Yo, without feeling their weight, and contains the rivers and\\nseas, without their leaking away. The mountain now before us appears\\nonly a stone; but when contemplated in all the vastness of its size,\\nwe see how the grass and trees are produced on it, and birds and beasts\\ndwell on it, and precious things which men treasure up are found on\\nit. The water now before us appears but a ladleful; yet extending\\nour view to its unfathomable depths, the largest tortoises, iguanas,\\niguanodons, dragons, fishes, and turtles, are produced in it, articles\\nof value and sources of wealth abound in it. \\n\\nIt is said in the Book of Poetry, \"The ordinances of Heaven, how profound\\nare they and unceasing!\" The meaning is, that it is thus that Heaven\\nis Heaven. And again, \"How illustrious was it, the singleness of the\\nvirtue of King Wan!\" indicating that it was thus that King Wan was\\nwhat he was. Singleness likewise is unceasing. \\n\\nHow great is the path proper to the Sage! \\nLike overflowing water, it sends forth and nourishes all things, and\\nrises up to the height of heaven. \\n\\nAll-complete is its greatness! It embraces the three hundred rules\\nof ceremony, and the three thousand rules of demeanor. \\n\\nIt waits for the proper man, and then it is trodden. \\nHence it is said, \"Only by perfect virtue can the perfect path, in\\nall its courses, be made a fact.\" \\n\\nTherefore, the superior man honors his virtuous nature, and maintains\\nconstant inquiry and study, seeking to carry it out to its breadth\\nand greatness, so as to omit none of the more exquisite and minute\\npoints which it embraces, and to raise it to its greatest height and\\nbrilliancy, so as to pursue the course of the Mean. He cherishes his\\nold knowledge, and is continually acquiring new. He exerts an honest,\\ngenerous earnestness, in the esteem and practice of all propriety.\\n\\nThus, when occupying a high situation he is not proud, and in a low\\nsituation he is not insubordinate. When the kingdom is well governed,\\nhe is sure by his words to rise; and when it is ill governed, he is\\nsure by his silence to command forbearance to himself. Is not this\\nwhat we find in the Book of Poetry,-\"Intelligent is he and prudent,\\nand so preserves his person?\" \\n\\nThe Master said, Let a man who is ignorant be fond of using his own\\njudgment; let a man without rank be fond of assuming a directing power\\nto himself; let a man who is living in the present age go back to\\nthe ways of antiquity;-on the persons of all who act thus calamities\\nwill be sure to come. \\n\\nTo no one but the Son of Heaven does it belong to order ceremonies,\\nto fix the measures, and to determine the written characters.\\n\\nNow over the kingdom, carriages have all wheels, of the-same size;\\nall writing is with the same characters; and for conduct there are\\nthe same rules. \\n\\nOne may occupy the throne, but if he have not the proper virtue, he\\nmay not dare to make ceremonies or music. One may have the virtue,\\nbut if he do not occupy the throne, he may not presume to make ceremonies\\nor music. \\n\\nThe Master said, \"I may describe the ceremonies of the Hsia dynasty,\\nbut Chi cannot sufficiently attest my words. I have learned the ceremonies\\nof the Yin dynasty, and in Sung they still continue. I have learned\\nthe ceremonies of Chau, which are now used, and I follow Chau.\"\\n\\nHe who attains to the sovereignty of the kingdom, having those three\\nimportant things, shall be able to effect that there shall be few\\nerrors under his government. \\n\\nHowever excellent may have been the regulations of those of former\\ntimes, they cannot be attested. Not being attested, they cannot command\\ncredence, and not being credited, the people would not follow them.\\nHowever excellent might be the regulations made by one in an inferior\\nsituation, he is not in a position to be honored. Unhonored, he cannot\\ncommand credence, and not being credited, the people would not follow\\nhis rules. \\n\\nTherefore the institutions of the Ruler are rooted in his own character\\nand conduct, and sufficient attestation of them is given by the masses\\nof the people. He examines them by comparison with those of the three\\nkings, and finds them without mistake. He sets them up before Heaven\\nand Earth, and finds nothing in them contrary to their mode of operation.\\nHe presents himself with them before spiritual beings, and no doubts\\nabout them arise. He is prepared to wait for the rise of a sage a\\nhundred ages after, and has no misgivings. \\n\\nHis presenting himself with his institutions before spiritual beings,\\nwithout any doubts arising about them, shows that he knows Heaven.\\nHis being prepared, without any misgivings, to wait for the rise of\\na sage a hundred ages after, shows that he knows men. \\n\\nSuch being the case, the movements of such a ruler, illustrating his\\ninstitutions, constitute an example to the world for ages. His acts\\nare for ages a law to the kingdom. His words are for ages a lesson\\nto the kingdom. Those who are far from him look longingly for him;\\nand those who are near him are never wearied with him. \\n\\nIt is said in the Book of Poetry,-\"Not disliked there, not tired of\\nhere, from day to day and night tonight, will they perpetuate their\\npraise.\" Never has there been a ruler, who did not realize this description,\\nthat obtained an early renown throughout the kingdom. \\n\\nChung-ni handed down the doctrines of Yao and Shun, as if they had\\nbeen his ancestors, and elegantly displayed the regulations of Wan\\nand Wul taking them as his model. Above, he harmonized with the times\\nof Heaven, and below, he was conformed to the water and land.\\n\\nHe may be compared to Heaven and Earth in their supporting and containing,\\ntheir overshadowing and curtaining, all things. He may be compared\\nto the four seasons in their alternating progress, and to the sun\\nand moon in their successive shining. \\n\\nAll things are nourished together without their injuring one another.\\nThe courses of the seasons, and of the sun and moon, are pursued without\\nany collision among them. The smaller energies are like river currents;\\nthe greater energies are seen in mighty transformations. It is this\\nwhich makes heaven and earth so great. \\n\\nIt is only he, possessed of all sagely qualities that can exist under\\nheaven, who shows himself quick in apprehension, clear in discernment,\\nof far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge, fitted\\nto exercise rule; magnanimous, generous, benign, and mild, fitted\\nto exercise forbearance; impulsive, energetic, firm, and enduring,\\nfitted to maintain a firm hold; self-adjusted, grave, never swerving\\nfrom the Mean, and correct, fitted to command reverence; accomplished,\\ndistinctive, concentrative, and searching, fitted to exercise discrimination.\\n\\nAll-embracing is he and vast, deep and active as a fountain, sending\\nforth in their due season his virtues. \\n\\nAll-embracing and vast, he is like Heaven. Deep and active as a fountain,\\nhe is like the abyss. He is seen, and the people all reverence him;\\nhe speaks, and the people all believe him; he acts, and the people\\nall are pleased with him. \\n\\nTherefore his fame overspreads the Middle Kingdom, and extends to\\nall barbarous tribes. Wherever ships and carriages reach; wherever\\nthe strength of man penetrates; wherever the heavens overshadow and\\nthe earth sustains; wherever the sun and moon shine; wherever frosts\\nand dews fall:-all who have blood and breath unfeignedly honor and\\nlove him. Hence it is said,-\"He is the equal of Heaven.\"\\n\\nIt is only the individual possessed of the most entire sincerity that\\ncan exist under Heaven, who can adjust the great invariable relations\\nof mankind, establish the great fundamental virtues of humanity, and\\nknow the transforming and nurturing operations of Heaven and Earth;-shall\\nthis individual have any being or anything beyond himself on which\\nhe depends? \\n\\nCall him man in his ideal, how earnest is he! Call him an abyss, how\\ndeep is he! Call him Heaven, how vast is he! \\n\\nWho can know him, but he who is indeed quick in apprehension, clear\\nin discernment, of far-reaching intelligence, and all-embracing knowledge,\\npossessing all Heavenly virtue? \\n\\nIt is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Over her embroidered robe she puts\\na plain single garment,\" intimating a dislike to the display of the\\nelegance of the former. Just so, it is the way of the superior man\\nto prefer the concealment of his virtue, while it daily becomes more\\nillustrious, and it is the way of the mean man to seek notoriety,\\nwhile he daily goes more and more to ruin. It is characteristic of\\nthe superior man, appearing insipid, yet never to produce satiety;\\nwhile showing a simple negligence, yet to have his accomplishments\\nrecognized; while seemingly plain, yet to be discriminating. He knows\\nhow what is distant lies in what is near. He knows where the wind\\nproceeds from. He knows how what is minute becomes manifested. Such\\na one, we may be sure, will enter into virtue. \\n\\nIt is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Although the fish sink and lie\\nat the bottom, it is still quite clearly seen.\" Therefore the superior\\nman examines his heart, that there may be nothing wrong there, and\\nthat he may have no cause for dissatisfaction with himself. That wherein\\nthe superior man cannot be equaled is simply this,-his work which\\nother men cannot see. \\n\\nIt is said in the Book of Poetry, \"Looked at in your apartment, be\\nthere free from shame as being exposed to the light of Heaven.\" Therefore,\\nthe superior man, even when he is not moving, has a feeling of reverence,\\nand while he speaks not, he has the feeling of truthfulness.\\n\\nIt is said in the Book of Poetry, \"In silence is the offering presented,\\nand the spirit approached to; there is not the slightest contention.\"\\nTherefore the superior man does not use rewards, and the people are\\nstimulated to virtue. He does not show anger, and the people are awed\\nmore than by hatchets and battle-axes. \\n\\nIt is said in the Book of Poetry, \"What needs no display is virtue.\\nAll the princes imitate it.\" Therefore, the superior man being sincere\\nand reverential, the whole world is conducted to a state of happy\\ntranquility. \\n\\nIt is said in the Book of Poetry, \"I regard with pleasure your brilliant\\nvirtue, making no great display of itself in sounds and appearances.\"\\nThe Master said, \"Among the appliances to transform the people, sound\\nand appearances are but trivial influences. It is said in another\\node, \\'His Virtue is light as a hair.\\' Still, a hair will admit of\\ncomparison as to its size. \\'The doings of the supreme Heaven have\\nneither sound nor smell. \\'That is perfect virtue.\" \\n\\nTHE END', shape=(), dtype=string)\n",
            "tf.Tensor(b'The History of Herodotus\\nBy Herodotus\\n\\n\\nTranslated by George Rawlinson\\n\\nBOOK I\\n\\nClio \\n\\nThese are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus, which he publishes,\\nin the hope of thereby preserving from decay the remembrance of what\\nmen have done, and of preventing the great and wonderful actions of\\nthe Greeks and the Barbarians from losing their due meed of glory;\\nand withal to put on record what were their grounds of feuds. According\\nto the Persians best informed in history, the Phoenicians began to\\nquarrel. This people, who had formerly dwelt on the shores of the\\nErythraean Sea, having migrated to the Mediterranean and settled in\\nthe parts which they now inhabit, began at once, they say, to adventure\\non long voyages, freighting their vessels with the wares of Egypt\\nand Assyria. They landed at many places on the coast, and among the\\nrest at Argos, which was then preeminent above all the states included\\nnow under the common name of Hellas. Here they exposed their merchandise,\\nand traded with the natives for five or six days; at the end of which\\ntime, when almost everything was sold, there came down to the beach\\na number of women, and among them the daughter of the king, who was,\\nthey say, agreeing in this with the Greeks, Io, the child of Inachus.\\nThe women were standing by the stern of the ship intent upon their\\npurchases, when the Phoenicians, with a general shout, rushed upon\\nthem. The greater part made their escape, but some were seized and\\ncarried off. Io herself was among the captives. The Phoenicians put\\nthe women on board their vessel, and set sail for Egypt. Thus did\\nIo pass into Egypt, according to the Persian story, which differs\\nwidely from the Phoenician: and thus commenced, according to their\\nauthors, the series of outrages. \\n\\nAt a later period, certain Greeks, with whose name they are unacquainted,\\nbut who would probably be Cretans, made a landing at Tyre, on the\\nPhoenician coast, and bore off the king\\'s daughter, Europe. In this\\nthey only retaliated; but afterwards the Greeks, they say, were guilty\\nof a second violence. They manned a ship of war, and sailed to Aea,\\na city of Colchis, on the river Phasis; from whence, after despatching\\nthe rest of the business on which they had come, they carried off\\nMedea, the daughter of the king of the land. The monarch sent a herald\\ninto Greece to demand reparation of the wrong, and the restitution\\nof his child; but the Greeks made answer that, having received no\\nreparation of the wrong done them in the seizure of Io the Argive,\\nthey should give none in this instance. \\n\\nIn the next generation afterwards, according to the same authorities,\\nAlexander the son of Priam, bearing these events in mind, resolved\\nto procure himself a wife out of Greece by violence, fully persuaded,\\nthat as the Greeks had not given satisfaction for their outrages,\\nso neither would he be forced to make any for his. Accordingly he\\nmade prize of Helen; upon which the Greeks decided that, before resorting\\nto other measures, they would send envoys to reclaim the princess\\nand require reparation of the wrong. Their demands were met by a reference\\nto the violence which had been offered to Medea, and they were asked\\nwith what face they could now require satisfaction, when they had\\nformerly rejected all demands for either reparation or restitution\\naddressed to them. \\n\\nHitherto the injuries on either side had been mere acts of common\\nviolence; but in what followed the Persians consider that the Greeks\\nwere greatly to blame, since before any attack had been made on Europe,\\nthey led an army into Asia. Now as for the carrying off of women,\\nit is the deed, they say, of a rogue: but to make a stir about such\\nas are carried off, argues a man a fool. Men of sense care nothing\\nfor such women, since it is plain that without their own consent they\\nwould never be forced away. The Asiatics, when the Greeks ran off\\nwith their women, never troubled themselves about the matter; but\\nthe Greeks, for the sake of a single Lacedaemonian girl, collected\\na vast armament, invaded Asia, and destroyed the kingdom of Priam.\\nHenceforth they ever looked upon the Greeks as their open enemies.\\nFor Asia, with all the various tribes of barbarians that inhabit it,\\nis regarded by the Persians as their own; but Europe and the Greek\\nrace they look on as distinct and separate. \\n\\nSuch is the account which the Persians give of these matters. They\\ntrace to the attack upon Troy their ancient enmity towards the Greeks.\\nThe Phoenicians, however, as regards Io, vary from the Persian statements.\\nThey deny that they used any violence to remove her into Egypt; she\\nherself, they say, having formed an intimacy with the captain, while\\nhis vessel lay at Argos, and perceiving herself to be with child,\\nof her own free will accompanied the Phoenicians on their leaving\\nthe shore, to escape the shame of detection and the reproaches of\\nher parents. Whether this latter account be true, or whether the matter\\nhappened otherwise, I shall not discuss further. I shall proceed at\\nonce to point out the person who first within my own knowledge inflicted\\ninjury on the Greeks, after which I shall go forward with my history,\\ndescribing equally the greater and the lesser cities. For the cities\\nwhich were formerly great have most of them become insignificant;\\nand such as are at present powerful, were weak in the olden time.\\nI shall therefore discourse equally of both, convinced that human\\nhappiness never continues long in one stay. \\n\\nCroesus, son of Alyattes, by birth a Lydian, was lord of all the nations\\nto the west of the river Halys. This stream, which separates Syria\\nfrom Paphlagonia, runs with a course from south to north, and finally\\nfalls into the Euxine. So far as our knowledge goes, he was the first\\nof the barbarians who had dealings with the Greeks, forcing some of\\nthem to become his tributaries, and entering into alliance with others.\\nHe conquered the Aeolians, Ionians, and Dorians of Asia, and made\\na treaty with the Lacedaemonians. Up to that time all Greeks had been\\nfree. For the Cimmerian attack upon Ionia, which was earlier than\\nCroesus, was not a conquest of the cities, but only an inroad for\\nplundering. \\n\\nThe sovereignty of Lydia, which had belonged to the Heraclides, passed\\ninto the family of Croesus, who were called the Mermnadae, in the\\nmanner which I will now relate. There was a certain king of Sardis,\\nCandaules by name, whom the Greeks called Myrsilus. He was a descendant\\nof Alcaeus, son of Hercules. The first king of this dynasty was Agron,\\nson of Ninus, grandson of Belus, and great-grandson of Alcaeus; Candaules,\\nson of Myrsus, was the last. The kings who reigned before Agron sprang\\nfrom Lydus, son of Atys, from whom the people of the land, called\\npreviously Meonians, received the name of Lydians. The Heraclides,\\ndescended from Hercules and the slave-girl of Jardanus, having been\\nentrusted by these princes with the management of affairs, obtained\\nthe kingdom by an oracle. Their rule endured for two and twenty generations\\nof men, a space of five hundred and five years; during the whole of\\nwhich period, from Agron to Candaules, the crown descended in the\\ndirect line from father to son. \\n\\nNow it happened that this Candaules was in love with his own wife;\\nand not only so, but thought her the fairest woman in the whole world.\\nThis fancy had strange consequences. There was in his bodyguard a\\nman whom he specially favoured, Gyges, the son of Dascylus. All affairs\\nof greatest moment were entrusted by Candaules to this person, and\\nto him he was wont to extol the surpassing beauty of his wife. So\\nmatters went on for a while. At length, one day, Candaules, who was\\nfated to end ill, thus addressed his follower: \"I see thou dost not\\ncredit what I tell thee of my lady\\'s loveliness; but come now, since\\nmen\\'s ears are less credulous than their eyes, contrive some means\\nwhereby thou mayst behold her naked.\" At this the other loudly exclaimed,\\nsaying, \"What most unwise speech is this, master, which thou hast\\nuttered? Wouldst thou have me behold my mistress when she is naked?\\nBethink thee that a woman, with her clothes, puts off her bashfulness.\\nOur fathers, in time past, distinguished right and wrong plainly enough,\\nand it is our wisdom to submit to be taught by them. There is an old\\nsaying, \\'Let each look on his own.\\' I hold thy wife for the fairest\\nof all womankind. Only, I beseech thee, ask me not to do wickedly.\"\\n\\nGyges thus endeavoured to decline the king\\'s proposal, trembling lest\\nsome dreadful evil should befall him through it. But the king replied\\nto him, \"Courage, friend; suspect me not of the design to prove thee\\nby this discourse; nor dread thy mistress, lest mischief be. thee\\nat her hands. Be sure I will so manage that she shall not even know\\nthat thou hast looked upon her. I will place thee behind the open\\ndoor of the chamber in which we sleep. When I enter to go to rest\\nshe will follow me. There stands a chair close to the entrance, on\\nwhich she will lay her clothes one by one as she takes them off. Thou\\nwilt be able thus at thy leisure to peruse her person. Then, when\\nshe is moving from the chair toward the bed, and her back is turned\\non thee, be it thy care that she see thee not as thou passest through\\nthe doorway.\" \\n\\nGyges, unable to escape, could but declare his readiness. Then Candaules,\\nwhen bedtime came, led Gyges into his sleeping-chamber, and a moment\\nafter the queen followed. She entered, and laid her garments on the\\nchair, and Gyges gazed on her. After a while she moved toward the\\nbed, and her back being then turned, he glided stealthily from the\\napartment. As he was passing out, however, she saw him, and instantly\\ndivining what had happened, she neither screamed as her shame impelled\\nher, nor even appeared to have noticed aught, purposing to take vengeance\\nupon the husband who had so affronted her. For among the Lydians,\\nand indeed among the barbarians generally, it is reckoned a deep disgrace,\\neven to a man, to be seen naked. \\n\\nNo sound or sign of intelligence escaped her at the time. But in the\\nmorning, as soon as day broke, she hastened to choose from among her\\nretinue such as she knew to be most faithful to her, and preparing\\nthem for what was to ensue, summoned Gyges into her presence. Now\\nit had often happened before that the queen had desired to confer\\nwith him, and he was accustomed to come to her at her call. He therefore\\nobeyed the summons, not suspecting that she knew aught of what had\\noccurred. Then she addressed these words to him: \"Take thy choice,\\nGyges, of two courses which are open to thee. Slay Candaules, and\\nthereby become my lord, and obtain the Lydian throne, or die this\\nmoment in his room. So wilt thou not again, obeying all behests of\\nthy master, behold what is not lawful for thee. It must needs be that\\neither he perish by whose counsel this thing was done, or thou, who\\nsawest me naked, and so didst break our usages.\" At these words Gyges\\nstood awhile in mute astonishment; recovering after a time, he earnestly\\nbesought the queen that she would not compel him to so hard a choice.\\nBut finding he implored in vain, and that necessity was indeed laid\\non him to kill or to be killed, he made choice of life for himself,\\nand replied by this inquiry: \"If it must be so, and thou compellest\\nme against my will to put my lord to death, come, let me hear how\\nthou wilt have me set on him.\" \"Let him be attacked,\" she answered,\\n\"on the spot where I was by him shown naked to you, and let the assault\\nbe made when he is asleep.\" \\n\\nAll was then prepared for the attack, and when night fell, Gyges,\\nseeing that he had no retreat or escape, but must absolutely either\\nslay Candaules, or himself be slain, followed his mistress into the\\nsleeping-room. She placed a dagger in his hand and hid him carefully\\nbehind the self-same door. Then Gyges, when the king was fallen asleep,\\nentered privily into the chamber and struck him dead. Thus did the\\nwife and kingdom of Candaules pass into the possession of Gyges, of\\nwhom Archilochus the Parian, who lived about the same time, made mention\\nin a poem written in iambic trimeter verse. \\n\\nGyges was afterwards confirmed in the possession of the throne by\\nan answer of the Delphic oracle. Enraged at the murder of their king,\\nthe people flew to arms, but after a while the partisans of Gyges\\ncame to terms with them, and it was agreed that if the Delphic oracle\\ndeclared him king of the Lydians, he should reign; if otherwise, he\\nshould yield the throne to the Heraclides. As the oracle was given\\nin his favour he became king. The Pythoness, however, added that,\\nin the fifth generation from Gyges, vengeance should come for the\\nHeraclides; a prophecy of which neither the Lydians nor their princes\\ntook any account till it was fulfilled. Such was the way in which\\nthe Mermnadae deposed the Heraclides, and themselves obtained the\\nsovereignty. \\n\\nWhen Gyges was established on the throne, he sent no small presents\\nto Delphi, as his many silver offerings at the Delphic shrine testify.\\nBesides this silver he gave a vast number of vessels of gold, among\\nwhich the most worthy of mention are the goblets, six in number, and\\nweighing altogether thirty talents, which stand in the Corinthian\\ntreasury, dedicated by him. I call it the Corinthian treasury, though\\nin strictness of speech it is the treasury not of the whole Corinthian\\npeople, but of Cypselus, son of Eetion. Excepting Midas, son of Gordias,\\nking of Phrygia, Gyges was the first of the barbarians whom we know\\nto have sent offerings to Delphi. Midas dedicated the royal throne\\nwhereon he was accustomed to sit and administer justice, an object\\nwell worth looking at. It lies in the same place as the goblets presented\\nby Gyges. The Delphians call the whole of the silver and the gold\\nwhich Gyges dedicated, after the name of the donor, Gygian.\\n\\nAs soon as Gyges was king he made an in-road on Miletus and Smyrna,\\nand took the city of Colophon. Afterwards, however, though he reigned\\neight and thirty years, he did not perform a single noble exploit.\\nI shall therefore make no further mention of him, but pass on to his\\nson and successor in the kingdom, Ardys. \\n\\nArdys took Priene and made war upon Miletus. In his reign the Cimmerians,\\ndriven from their homes by the nomads of Scythia, entered Asia and\\ncaptured Sardis, all but the citadel. He reigned forty-nine years,\\nand was succeeded by his son, Sadyattes, who reigned twelve years.\\nAt his death his son Alyattes mounted the throne. \\n\\nThis prince waged war with the Medes under Cyaxares, the grandson\\nof Deioces, drove the Cimmerians out of Asia, conquered Smyrna, the\\nColophonian colony, and invaded Clazomenae. From this last contest\\nhe did not come off as he could have wished, but met with a sore defeat;\\nstill, however, in the course of his reign, he performed other actions\\nvery worthy of note, of which I will now proceed to give an account.\\n\\nInheriting from his father a war with the Milesians, he pressed the\\nsiege against the city by attacking it in the following manner. When\\nthe harvest was ripe on the ground he marched his army into Milesia\\nto the sound of pipes and harps, and flutes masculine and feminine.\\nThe buildings that were scattered over the country he neither pulled\\ndown nor burnt, nor did he even tear away the doors, but left them\\nstanding as they were. He cut down, however, and utterly destroyed\\nall the trees and all the corn throughout the land, and then returned\\nto his own dominions. It was idle for his army to sit down before\\nthe place, as the Milesians were masters of the sea. The reason that\\nhe did not demolish their buildings was that the inhabitants might\\nbe tempted to use them as homesteads from which to go forth to sow\\nand till their lands; and so each time that he invaded the country\\nhe might find something to plunder. \\n\\nIn this way he carried on the war with the Milesians for eleven years,\\nin the course of which he inflicted on them two terrible blows; one\\nin their own country in the district of Limeneium, the other in the\\nplain of the Maeander. During six of these eleven years, Sadyattes,\\nthe son of Ardys who first lighted the flames of this war, was king\\nof Lydia, and made the incursions. Only the five following years belong\\nto the reign of Alyattes, son of Sadyattes, who (as I said before)\\ninheriting the war from his father, applied himself to it unremittingly.\\nThe Milesians throughout the contest received no help at all from\\nany of the Ionians, excepting those of Chios, who lent them troops\\nin requital of a like service rendered them in former times, the Milesians\\nhaving fought on the side of the Chians during the whole of the war\\nbetween them and the people of Erythrae. \\n\\nIt was in the twelfth year of the war that the following mischance\\noccurred from the firing of the harvest-fields. Scarcely had the corn\\nbeen set alight by the soldiers when a violent wind carried the flames\\nagainst the temple of Minerva Assesia, which caught fire and was burnt\\nto the ground. At the time no one made any account of the circumstance;\\nbut afterwards, on the return of the army to Sardis, Alyattes fell\\nsick. His illness continued, whereupon, either advised thereto by\\nsome friend, or perchance himself conceiving the idea, he sent messengers\\nto Delphi to inquire of the god concerning his malady. On their arrival\\nthe Pythoness declared that no answer should be given them until they\\nhad rebuilt the temple of Minerva, burnt by the Lydians at Assesus\\nin Milesia. \\n\\nThus much I know from information given me by the Delphians; the remainder\\nof the story the Milesians add. \\n\\nThe answer made by the oracle came to the ears of Periander, son of\\nCypselus, who was a very close friend to Thrasybulus, tyrant of Miletus\\nat that period. He instantly despatched a messenger to report the\\noracle to him, in order that Thrasybulus, forewarned of its tenor,\\nmight the better adapt his measures to the posture of affairs.\\n\\nAlyattes, the moment that the words of the oracle were reported to\\nhim, sent a herald to Miletus in hopes of concluding a truce with\\nThrasybulus and the Milesians for such a time as was needed to rebuild\\nthe temple. The herald went upon his way; but meantime Thrasybulus\\nhad been apprised of everything; and conjecturing what Alyattes would\\ndo, he contrived this artifice. He had all the corn that was in the\\ncity, whether belonging to himself or to private persons, brought\\ninto the market-place, and issued an order that the Milesians should\\nhold themselves in readiness, and, when he gave the signal, should,\\none and all, fall to drinking and revelry. \\n\\nThe purpose for which he gave these orders was the following. He hoped\\nthat the Sardian herald, seeing so great store of corn upon the ground,\\nand all the city given up to festivity, would inform Alyattes of it,\\nwhich fell out as he anticipated. The herald observed the whole, and\\nwhen he had delivered his message, went back to Sardis. This circumstance\\nalone, as I gather, brought about the peace which ensued. Alyattes,\\nwho had hoped that there was now a great scarcity of corn in Miletus,\\nand that the people were worn down to the last pitch of suffering,\\nwhen he heard from the herald on his return from Miletus tidings so\\ncontrary to those he had expected, made a treaty with the enemy by\\nwhich the two nations became close friends and allies. He then built\\nat Assesus two temples to Minerva instead of one, and shortly after\\nrecovered from his malady. Such were the chief circumstances of the\\nwar which Alyattes waged with Thrasybulus and the Milesians.\\n\\nThis Periander, who apprised Thrasybulus of the oracle, was son of\\nCypselus, and tyrant of Corinth. In his time a very wonderful thing\\nis said to have happened. The Corinthians and the Lesbians agree in\\ntheir account of the matter. They relate that Arion of Methymna, who\\nas a player on the harp, was second to no man living at that time,\\nand who was, so far as we know, the first to invent the dithyrambic\\nmeasure, to give it its name, and to recite in it at Corinth, was\\ncarried to Taenarum on the back of a dolphin. \\n\\nHe had lived for many years at the court of Periander, when a longing\\ncame upon him to sail across to Italy and Sicily. Having made rich\\nprofits in those parts, he wanted to recross the seas to Corinth.\\nHe therefore hired a vessel, the crew of which were Corinthians, thinking\\nthat there was no people in whom he could more safely confide; and,\\ngoing on board, he set sail from Tarentum. The sailors, however, when\\nthey reached the open sea, formed a plot to throw him overboard and\\nseize upon his riches. Discovering their design, he fell on his knees,\\nbeseeching them to spare his life, and making them welcome to his\\nmoney. But they refused; and required him either to kill himself outright,\\nif he wished for a grave on the dry land, or without loss of time\\nto leap overboard into the sea. In this strait Arion begged them,\\nsince such was their pleasure, to allow him to mount upon the quarter-deck,\\ndressed in his full costume, and there to play and sing, and promising\\nthat, as soon as his song was ended, he would destroy himself. Delighted\\nat the prospect of hearing the very best harper in the world, they\\nconsented, and withdrew from the stern to the middle of the vessel:\\nwhile Arion dressed himself in the full costume of his calling, took\\nhis harp, and standing on the quarter-deck, chanted the Orthian. His\\nstrain ended, he flung himself, fully attired as he was, headlong\\ninto the sea. The Corinthians then sailed on to Corinth. As for Arion,\\na dolphin, they say, took him upon his back and carried him to Taenarum,\\nwhere he went ashore, and thence proceeded to Corinth in his musician\\'s\\ndress, and told all that had happened to him. Periander, however,\\ndisbelieved the story, and put Arion in ward, to prevent his leaving\\nCorinth, while he watched anxiously for the return of the mariners.\\nOn their arrival he summoned them before him and asked them if they\\ncould give him any tiding of Arion. They returned for answer that\\nhe was alive and in good health in Italy, and that they had left him\\nat Tarentum, where he was doing well. Thereupon Arion appeared before\\nthem, just as he was when he jumped from the vessel: the men, astonished\\nand detected in falsehood, could no longer deny their guilt. Such\\nis the account which the Corinthians and Lesbians give; and there\\nis to this day at Taenarum, an offering of Arion\\'s at the shrine,\\nwhich is a small figure in bronze, representing a man seated upon\\na dolphin. \\n\\nHaving brought the war with the Milesians to a close, and reigned\\nover the land of Lydia for fifty-seven years, Alyattes died. He was\\nthe second prince of his house who made offerings at Delphi. His gifts,\\nwhich he sent on recovering from his sickness, were a great bowl of\\npure silver, with a salver in steel curiously inlaid, a work among\\nall the offerings at Delphi the best worth looking at. Glaucus, the\\nChian, made it, the man who first invented the art of inlaying steel.\\n\\nOn the death of Alyattes, Croesus, his son, who was thirty-five years\\nold, succeeded to the throne. Of the Greek cities, Ephesus was the\\nfirst that he attacked. The Ephesians, when he laid siege to the place,\\nmade an offering of their city to Diana, by stretching a rope from\\nthe town wall to the temple of the goddess, which was distant from\\nthe ancient city, then besieged by Croesus, a space of seven furlongs.\\nThey were, as I said, the first Greeks whom he attacked. Afterwards,\\non some pretext or other, he made war in turn upon every Ionian and\\nAeolian state, bringing forward, where he could, a substantial ground\\nof complaint; where such failed him, advancing some poor excuse.\\n\\nIn this way he made himself master of all the Greek cities in Asia,\\nand forced them to become his tributaries; after which he began to\\nthink of building ships, and attacking the islanders. Everything had\\nbeen got ready for this purpose, when Bias of Priene (or, as some\\nsay, Pittacus the Mytilenean) put a stop to the project. The king\\nhad made inquiry of this person, who was lately arrived at Sardis,\\nif there were any news from Greece; to which he answered, \"Yes, sire,\\nthe islanders are gathering ten thousand horse, designing an expedition\\nagainst thee and against thy capital.\" Croesus, thinking he spake\\nseriously, broke out, \"Ah, might the gods put such a thought into\\ntheir minds as to attack the sons of the Lydians with cavalry!\" \"It\\nseems, oh! king,\" rejoined the other, \"that thou desirest earnestly\\nto catch the islanders on horseback upon the mainland,- thou knowest\\nwell what would come of it. But what thinkest thou the islanders desire\\nbetter, now that they hear thou art about to build ships and sail\\nagainst them, than to catch the Lydians at sea, and there revenge\\non them the wrongs of their brothers upon the mainland, whom thou\\nholdest in slavery?\" Croesus was charmed with the turn of the speech;\\nand thinking there was reason in what was said, gave up his ship-building\\nand concluded a league of amity with the Ionians of the isles.\\n\\nCroesus afterwards, in the course of many years, brought under his\\nsway almost all the nations to the west of the Halys. The Lycians\\nand Cilicians alone continued free; all the other tribes he reduced\\nand held in subjection. They were the following: the Lydians, Phrygians,\\nMysians, Mariandynians, Chalybians, Paphlagonians, Thynian and Bithynian\\nThracians, Carians, Ionians, Dorians, Aeolians and Pamphylians.\\n\\nWhen all these conquests had been added to the Lydian empire, and\\nthe prosperity of Sardis was now at its height, there came thither,\\none after another, all the sages of Greece living at the time, and\\namong them Solon, the Athenian. He was on his travels, having left\\nAthens to be absent ten years, under the pretence of wishing to see\\nthe world, but really to avoid being forced to repeal any of the laws\\nwhich, at the request of the Athenians, he had made for them. Without\\nhis sanction the Athenians could not repeal them, as they had bound\\nthemselves under a heavy curse to be governed for ten years by the\\nlaws which should be imposed on them by Solon. \\n\\nOn this account, as well as to see the world, Solon set out upon his\\ntravels, in the course of which he went to Egypt to the court of Amasis,\\nand also came on a visit to Croesus at Sardis. Croesus received him\\nas his guest, and lodged him in the royal palace. On the third or\\nfourth day after, he bade his servants conduct Solon. over his treasuries,\\nand show him all their greatness and magnificence. When he had seen\\nthem all, and, so far as time allowed, inspected them, Croesus addressed\\nthis question to him. \"Stranger of Athens, we have heard much of thy\\nwisdom and of thy travels through many lands, from love of knowledge\\nand a wish to see the world. I am curious therefore to inquire of\\nthee, whom, of all the men that thou hast seen, thou deemest the most\\nhappy?\" This he asked because he thought himself the happiest of mortals:\\nbut Solon answered him without flattery, according to his true sentiments,\\n\"Tellus of Athens, sire.\" Full of astonishment at what he heard, Croesus\\ndemanded sharply, \"And wherefore dost thou deem Tellus happiest?\"\\nTo which the other replied, \"First, because his country was flourishing\\nin his days, and he himself had sons both beautiful and good, and\\nhe lived to see children born to each of them, and these children\\nall grew up; and further because, after a life spent in what our people\\nlook upon as comfort, his end was surpassingly glorious. In a battle\\nbetween the Athenians and their neighbours near Eleusis, he came to\\nthe assistance of his countrymen, routed the foe, and died upon the\\nfield most gallantly. The Athenians gave him a public funeral on the\\nspot where he fell, and paid him the highest honours.\" \\n\\nThus did Solon admonish Croesus by the example of Tellus, enumerating\\nthe manifold particulars of his happiness. When he had ended, Croesus\\ninquired a second time, who after Tellus seemed to him the happiest,\\nexpecting that at any rate, he would be given the second place. \"Cleobis\\nand Bito,\" Solon answered; \"they were of Argive race; their fortune\\nwas enough for their wants, and they were besides endowed with so\\nmuch bodily strength that they had both gained prizes at the Games.\\nAlso this tale is told of them:- There was a great festival in honour\\nof the goddess Juno at Argos, to which their mother must needs be\\ntaken in a car. Now the oxen did not come home from the field in time:\\nso the youths, fearful of being too late, put the yoke on their own\\nnecks, and themselves drew the car in which their mother rode. Five\\nand forty furlongs did they draw her, and stopped before the temple.\\nThis deed of theirs was witnessed by the whole assembly of worshippers,\\nand then their life closed in the best possible way. Herein, too,\\nGod showed forth most evidently, how much better a thing for man death\\nis than life. For the Argive men, who stood around the car, extolled\\nthe vast strength of the youths; and the Argive women extolled the\\nmother who was blessed with such a pair of sons; and the mother herself,\\noverjoyed at the deed and at the praises it had won, standing straight\\nbefore the image, besought the goddess to bestow on Cleobis and Bito,\\nthe sons who had so mightily honoured her, the highest blessing to\\nwhich mortals can attain. Her prayer ended, they offered sacrifice\\nand partook of the holy banquet, after which the two youths fell asleep\\nin the temple. They never woke more, but so passed from the earth.\\nThe Argives, looking on them as among the best of men, caused statues\\nof them to be made, which they gave to the shrine at Delphi.\"\\n\\nWhen Solon had thus assigned these youths the second place, Croesus\\nbroke in angrily, \"What, stranger of Athens, is my happiness, then,\\nso utterly set at nought by thee, that thou dost not even put me on\\na level with private men?\" \\n\\n\"Oh! Croesus,\" replied the other, \"thou askedst a question concerning\\nthe condition of man, of one who knows that the power above us is\\nfull of jealousy, and fond of troubling our lot. A long life gives\\none to witness much, and experience much oneself, that one would not\\nchoose. Seventy years I regard as the limit of the life of man. In\\nthese seventy years are contained, without reckoning intercalary months,\\ntwenty-five thousand and two hundred days. Add an intercalary month\\nto every other year, that the seasons may come round at the right\\ntime, and there will be, besides the seventy years, thirty-five such\\nmonths, making an addition of one thousand and fifty days. The whole\\nnumber of the days contained in the seventy years will thus be twenty-six\\nthousand two hundred and fifty, whereof not one but will produce events\\nunlike the rest. Hence man is wholly accident. For thyself, oh! Croesus,\\nI see that thou art wonderfully rich, and art the lord of many nations;\\nbut with respect to that whereon thou questionest me, I have no answer\\nto give, until I hear that thou hast closed thy life happily. For\\nassuredly he who possesses great store of riches is no nearer happiness\\nthan he who has what suffices for his daily needs, unless it so hap\\nthat luck attend upon him, and so he continue in the enjoyment of\\nall his good things to the end of life. For many of the wealthiest\\nmen have been unfavoured of fortune, and many whose means were moderate\\nhave had excellent luck. Men of the former class excel those of the\\nlatter but in two respects; these last excel the former in many. The\\nwealthy man is better able to content his desires, and to bear up\\nagainst a sudden buffet of calamity. The other has less ability to\\nwithstand these evils (from which, however, his good luck keeps him\\nclear), but he enjoys all these following blessings: he is whole of\\nlimb, a stranger to disease, free from misfortune, happy in his children,\\nand comely to look upon. If, in addition to all this, he end his life\\nwell, he is of a truth the man of whom thou art in search, the man\\nwho may rightly be termed happy. Call him, however, until he die,\\nnot happy but fortunate. Scarcely, indeed, can any man unite all these\\nadvantages: as there is no country which contains within it all that\\nit needs, but each, while it possesses some things, lacks others,\\nand the best country is that which contains the most; so no single\\nhuman being is complete in every respect- something is always lacking.\\nHe who unites the greatest number of advantages, and retaining them\\nto the day of his death, then dies peaceably, that man alone, sire,\\nis, in my judgment, entitled to bear the name of \\'happy.\\' But in every\\nmatter it behoves us to mark well the end: for oftentimes God gives\\nmen a gleam of happiness, and then plunges them into ruin.\"\\n\\nSuch was the speech which Solon addressed to Croesus, a speech which\\nbrought him neither largess nor honour. The king saw him depart with\\nmuch indifference, since he thought that a man must be an arrant fool\\nwho made no account of present good, but bade men always wait and\\nmark the end. \\n\\nAfter Solon had gone away a dreadful vengeance, sent of God, came\\nupon Croesus, to punish him, it is likely, for deeming himself the\\nhappiest of men. First he had a dream in the night, which foreshowed\\nhim truly the evils that were about to befall him in the person of\\nhis son. For Croesus had two sons, one blasted by a natural defect,\\nbeing deaf and dumb; the other, distinguished far above all his co-mates\\nin every pursuit. The name of the last was Atys. It was this son concerning\\nwhom he dreamt a dream that he would die by the blow of an iron weapon.\\nWhen he woke, he considered earnestly with himself, and, greatly alarmed\\nat the dream, instantly made his son take a wife, and whereas in former\\nyears the youth had been wont to command the Lydian forces in the\\nfield, he now would not suffer him to accompany them. All the spears\\nand javelins, and weapons used in the wars, he removed out of the\\nmale apartments, and laid them in heaps in the chambers of the women,\\nfearing lest perhaps one of the weapons that hung against the wall\\nmight fall and strike him. \\n\\nNow it chanced that while he was making arrangements for the wedding,\\nthere came to Sardis a man under a misfortune, who had upon him the\\nstain of blood. He was by race a Phrygian, and belonged to the family\\nof the king. Presenting himself at the palace of Croesus, he prayed\\nto be admitted to purification according to the customs of the country.\\nNow the Lydian method of purifying is very nearly the same as the\\nGreek. Croesus granted the request, and went through all the customary\\nrites, after which he asked the suppliant of his birth and country,\\naddressing him as follows:- \"Who art thou, stranger, and from what\\npart of Phrygia fleddest thou to take refuge at my hearth? And whom,\\nmoreover, what man or what woman, hast thou slain?\" \"Oh! king,\" replied\\nthe Phrygian, \"I am the son of Gordias, son of Midas. I am named Adrastus.\\nThe man I unintentionally slew was my own brother. For this my father\\ndrove me from the land, and I lost all. Then fled I here to thee.\"\\n\"Thou art the offspring,\" Croesus rejoined, \"of a house friendly to\\nmine, and thou art come to friends. Thou shalt want for nothing so\\nlong as thou abidest in my dominions. Bear thy misfortune as easily\\nas thou mayest, so will it go best with thee.\" Thenceforth Adrastus\\nlived in the palace of the king. \\n\\nIt chanced that at this very same time there was in the Mysian Olympus\\na huge monster of a boar, which went forth often from this mountain\\ncountry, and wasted the corn-fields of the Mysians. Many a time had\\nthe Mysians collected to hunt the beast, but instead of doing him\\nany hurt, they came off always with some loss to themselves. At length\\nthey sent ambassadors to Croesus, who delivered their message to him\\nin these words: \"Oh! king, a mighty monster of a boar has appeared\\nin our parts, and destroys the labour of our hands. We do our best\\nto take him, but in vain. Now therefore we beseech thee to let thy\\nson accompany us back, with some chosen youths and hounds, that we\\nmay rid our country of the animal.\" Such was the tenor of their prayer.\\n\\nBut Croesus bethought him of his dream, and answered, \"Say no more\\nof my son going with you; that may not be in any wise. He is but just\\njoined in wedlock, and is busy enough with that. I will grant you\\na picked band of Lydians, and all my huntsmen and hounds; and I will\\ncharge those whom I send to use all zeal in aiding you to rid your\\ncountry of the brute.\" \\n\\nWith this reply the Mysians were content; but the king\\'s son, hearing\\nwhat the prayer of the Mysians was, came suddenly in, and on the refusal\\nof Croesus to let him go with them, thus addressed his father: \"Formerly,\\nmy father, it was deemed the noblest and most suitable thing for me\\nto frequent the wars and hunting-parties, and win myself glory in\\nthem; but now thou keepest me away from both, although thou hast never\\nbeheld in me either cowardice or lack of spirit. What face meanwhile\\nmust I wear as I walk to the forum or return from it? What must the\\ncitizens, what must my young bride think of me? What sort of man will\\nshe suppose her husband to be? Either, therefore, let me go to the\\nchase of this boar, or give me a reason why it is best for me to do\\naccording to thy wishes.\" \\n\\nThen Croesus answered, \"My son, it is not because I have seen in thee\\neither cowardice or aught else which has displeased me that I keep\\nthee back; but because a vision which came before me in a dream as\\nI slept, warned me that thou wert doomed to die young, pierced by\\nan iron weapon. It was this which first led me to hasten on thy wedding,\\nand now it hinders me from sending thee upon this enterprise. Fain\\nwould I keep watch over thee, if by any means I may cheat fate of\\nthee during my own lifetime. For thou art the one and only son that\\nI possess; the other, whose hearing is destroyed, I regard as if he\\nwere not.\" \\n\\n\"Ah! father,\" returned the youth, \"I blame thee not for keeping watch\\nover me after a dream so terrible; but if thou mistakest, if thou\\ndost not apprehend the dream aright, \\'tis no blame for me to show\\nthee wherein thou errest. Now the dream, thou saidst thyself, foretold\\nthat I should die stricken by an iron weapon. But what hands has a\\nboar to strike with? What iron weapon does he wield? Yet this is what\\nthou fearest for me. Had the dream said that I should die pierced\\nby a tusk, then thou hadst done well to keep me away; but it said\\na weapon. Now here we do not combat men, but a wild animal. I pray\\nthee, therefore, let me go with them.\" \\n\\n\"There thou hast me, my son,\" said Croesus, \"thy interpretation is\\nbetter than mine. I yield to it, and change my mind, and consent to\\nlet thee go.\" \\n\\nThen the king sent for Adrastus, the Phrygian, and said to him, \"Adrastus,\\nwhen thou wert smitten with the rod of affliction- no reproach, my\\nfriend- I purified thee, and have taken thee to live with me in my\\npalace, and have been at every charge. Now, therefore, it behoves\\nthee to requite the good offices which thou hast received at my hands\\nby consenting to go with my son on this hunting party, and to watch\\nover him, if perchance you should be attacked upon the road by some\\nband of daring robbers. Even apart from this, it were right for thee\\nto go where thou mayest make thyself famous by noble deeds. They are\\nthe heritage of thy family, and thou too art so stalwart and strong.\"\\n\\nAdrastus answered, \"Except for thy request, Oh! king, I would rather\\nhave kept away from this hunt; for methinks it ill beseems a man under\\na misfortune such as mine to consort with his happier compeers; and\\nbesides, I have no heart to it. On many grounds I had stayed behind;\\nbut, as thou urgest it, and I am bound to pleasure thee (for truly\\nit does behove me to requite thy good offices), I am content to do\\nas thou wishest. For thy son, whom thou givest into my charge, be\\nsure thou shalt receive him back safe and sound, so far as depends\\nupon a guardian\\'s carefulness.\" \\n\\nThus assured, Croesus let them depart, accompanied by a band of picked\\nyouths, and well provided with dogs of chase. When they reached Olympus,\\nthey scattered in quest of the animal; he was soon found, and the\\nhunters, drawing round him in a circle, hurled their weapons at him.\\nThen the stranger, the man who had been purified of blood, whose name\\nwas Adrastus, he also hurled his spear at the boar, but missed his\\naim, and struck Atys. Thus was the son of Croesus slain by the point\\nof an iron weapon, and the warning of the vision was fulfilled. Then\\none ran to Sardis to bear the tidings to the king, and he came and\\ninformed him of the combat and of the fate that had befallen his son.\\n\\nIf it was a heavy blow to the father to learn that his child was dead,\\nit yet more strongly affected him to think that the very man whom\\nhe himself once purified had done the deed. In the violence of his\\ngrief he called aloud on Jupiter Catharsius to be a witness of what\\nhe had suffered at the stranger\\'s hands. Afterwards he invoked the\\nsame god as Jupiter Ephistius and Hetaereus- using the one term because\\nhe had unwittingly harboured in his house the man who had now slain\\nhis son; and the other, because the stranger, who had been sent as\\nhis child\\'s guardian, had turned out his most cruel enemy.\\n\\nPresently the Lydians arrived, bearing the body of the youth, and\\nbehind them followed the homicide. He took his stand in front of the\\ncorse, and, stretching forth his hands to Croesus, delivered himself\\ninto his power with earnest entreaties that he would sacrifice him\\nupon the body of his son- \"his former misfortune was burthen enough;\\nnow that he had added to it a second, and had brought ruin on the\\nman who purified him, he could not bear to live.\" Then Croesus, when\\nhe heard these words, was moved with pity towards Adrastus, notwithstanding\\nthe bitterness of his own calamity; and so he answered, \"Enough, my\\nfriend; I have all the revenge that I require, since thou givest sentence\\nof death against thyself. But in sooth it is not thou who hast injured\\nme, except so far as thou hast unwittingly dealt the blow. Some god\\nis the author of my misfortune, and I was forewarned of it a long\\ntime ago.\" Croesus after this buried the body of his son, with such\\nhonours as befitted the occasion. Adrastus, son of Gordias, son of\\nMidas, the destroyer of his brother in time past, the destroyer now\\nof his purifier, regarding himself as the most unfortunate wretch\\nwhom he had ever known, so soon as all was quiet about the place,\\nslew himself upon the tomb. Croesus, bereft of his son, gave himself\\nup to mourning for two full years. \\n\\nAt the end of this time the grief of Croesus was interrupted by intelligence\\nfrom abroad. He learnt that Cyrus, the son of Cambyses, had destroyed\\nthe empire of Astyages, the son of Cyaxares; and that the Persians\\nwere becoming daily more powerful. This led him to consider with himself\\nwhether it were possible to check the growing power of that people\\nbefore it came to a head. With this design he resolved to make instant\\ntrial of the several oracles in Greece, and of the one in Libya. So\\nhe sent his messengers in different directions, some to Delphi, some\\nto Abae in Phocis, and some to Dodona; others to the oracle of Amphiaraus;\\nothers to that of Trophonius; others, again, to Branchidae in Milesia.\\nThese were the Greek oracles which he consulted. To Libya he sent\\nanother embassy, to consult the oracle of Ammon. These messengers\\nwere sent to test the knowledge of the oracles, that, if they were\\nfound really to return true answers, he might send a second time,\\nand inquire if he ought to attack the Persians. \\n\\nThe messengers who were despatched to make trial of the oracles were\\ngiven the following instructions: they were to keep count of the days\\nfrom the time of their leaving Sardis, and, reckoning from that date,\\non the hundredth day they were to consult the oracles, and to inquire\\nof them what Croesus the son of Alyattes, king of Lydia, was doing\\nat that moment. The answers given them were to be taken down in writing,\\nand brought back to him. None of the replies remain on record except\\nthat of the oracle at Delphi. There, the moment that the Lydians entered\\nthe sanctuary, and before they put their questions, the Pythoness\\nthus answered them in hexameter verse:- \\n\\nI can count the sands, and I can measure the ocean; \\nI have ears for the silent, and know what the dumb man meaneth;\\n\\nLo! on my sense there striketh the smell of a shell-covered\\n\\ntortoise, \\nBoiling now on a fire, with the flesh of a lamb, in a cauldron-\\n\\nBrass is the vessel below, and brass the cover above it.\\n\\nThese words the Lydians wrote down at the mouth of the Pythoness as\\nshe prophesied, and then set off on their return to Sardis. When all\\nthe messengers had come back with the answers which they had received,\\nCroesus undid the rolls, and read what was written in each. Only one\\napproved itself to him, that of the Delphic oracle. This he had no\\nsooner heard than he instantly made an act of adoration, and accepted\\nit as true, declaring that the Delphic was the only really oracular\\nshrine, the only one that had discovered in what way he was in fact\\nemployed. For on the departure of his messengers he had set himself\\nto think what was most impossible for any one to conceive of his doing,\\nand then, waiting till the day agreed on came, he acted as he had\\ndetermined. He took a tortoise and a lamb, and cutting them in pieces\\nwith his own hands, boiled them both together in a brazen cauldron,\\ncovered over with a lid which was also of brass. \\n\\nSuch then was the answer returned to Croesus from Delphi. What the\\nanswer was which the Lydians who went to the shrine of Amphiarans\\nand performed the customary rites obtained of the oracle there, I\\nhave it not in my power to mention, for there is no record of it.\\nAll that is known is that Croesus believed himself to have found there\\nalso an oracle which spoke the truth. \\n\\nAfter this Croesus, having resolved to propitiate the Delphic god\\nwith a magnificent sacrifice, offered up three thousand of every kind\\nof sacrificial beast, and besides made a huge pile, and placed upon\\nit couches coated with silver and with gold, and golden goblets, and\\nrobes and vests of purple; all which he burnt in the hope of thereby\\nmaking himself more secure of the favour of the god. Further he issued\\nhis orders to all the people of the land to offer a sacrifice according\\nto their means. When the sacrifice was ended, the king melted down\\na vast quantity of gold, and ran it into ingots, making them six palms\\nlong, three palms broad, and one palm in thickness. The number of\\ningots was a hundred and seventeen, four being of refined gold, in\\nweight two talents and a half; the others of pale gold, and in weight\\ntwo talents. He also caused a statue of a lion to be made in refined\\ngold, the weight of which was ten talents. At the time when the temple\\nof Delphi was burnt to the ground, this lion fell from the ingots\\non which it was placed; it now stands in the Corinthian treasury,\\nand weighs only six talents and a half, having lost three talents\\nand a half by the fire. \\n\\nOn the completion of these works Croesus sent them away to Delphi,\\nand with them two bowls of an enormous size, one of gold, the other\\nof silver, which used to stand, the latter upon the right, the former\\nupon the left, as one entered the temple. They too were moved at the\\ntime of the fire; and now the golden one is in the Clazomenian treasury,\\nand weighs eight talents and forty-two minae; the silver one stands\\nin the corner of the ante-chapel, and holds six hundred amphorae.\\nThis is known because the Delphians fill it at the time of the Theophania.\\nIt is said by the Delphians to be a work of Theodore the Samian, and\\nI think that they say true, for assuredly it is the work of no common\\nartist. Croesus sent also four silver casks, which are in the Corinthian\\ntreasury, and two lustral vases, a golden and a silver one. On the\\nformer is inscribed the name of the Lacedaemonians, and they claim\\nit as a gift of theirs, but wrongly, since it was really given by\\nCroesus. The inscription upon it was cut by a Delphian, who wished\\nto pleasure the Lacedaemonians. His name is known to me, but I forbear\\nto mention it. The boy, through whose hand the water runs, is (I confess)\\na Lacedaemonian gift, but they did not give either of the lustral\\nvases. Besides these various offerings, Croesus sent to Delphi many\\nothers of less account, among the rest a number of round silver basins.\\nAlso he dedicated a female figure in gold, three cubits high, which\\nis said by the Delphians to be the statue of his baking-woman; and\\nfurther, he presented the necklace and the girdles of his wife.\\n\\nThese were the offerings sent by Croesus to Delphi. To the shrine\\nof Amphiaraus, with whose valour and misfortune he was acquainted,\\nhe sent a shield entirely of gold, and a spear, also of solid gold,\\nboth head and shaft. They were still existing in my day at Thebes,\\nlaid up in the temple of Ismenian Apollo. \\n\\nThe messengers who had the charge of conveying these treasures to\\nthe shrines, received instructions to ask the oracles whether Croesus\\nshould go to war with the Persians and if so, whether he should strengthen\\nhimself by the forces of an ally. Accordingly, when they had reached\\ntheir destinations and presented the gifts, they proceeded to consult\\nthe oracles in the following terms:- \"Croesus, of Lydia and other\\ncountries, believing that these are the only real oracles in all the\\nworld, has sent you such presents as your discoveries deserved, and\\nnow inquires of you whether he shall go to war with the Persians,\\nand if so, whether he shall strengthen himself by the forces of a\\nconfederate.\" Both the oracles agreed in the tenor of their reply,\\nwhich was in each case a prophecy that if Croesus attacked the Persians,\\nhe would destroy a mighty empire, and a recommendation to him to look\\nand see who were the most powerful of the Greeks, and to make alliance\\nwith them. \\n\\nAt the receipt of these oracular replies Croesus was overjoyed, and\\nfeeling sure now that he would destroy the empire of the Persians,\\nhe sent once more to Pytho, and presented to the Delphians, the number\\nof whom he had ascertained, two gold staters apiece. In return for\\nthis the Delphians granted to Croesus and the Lydians the privilege\\nof precedency in consulting the oracle, exemption from all charges,\\nthe most honourable seat at the festivals, and the perpetual right\\nof becoming at pleasure citizens of their town. \\n\\nAfter sending these presents to the Delphians, Croesus a third time\\nconsulted the oracle, for having once proved its truthfulness, he\\nwished to make constant use of it. The question whereto he now desired\\nan answer was- \"Whether his kingdom would be of long duration?\" The\\nfollowing was the reply of the Pythoness:- \\n\\nWait till the time shall come when a mule is monarch of Media;\\n\\nThen, thou delicate Lydian, away to the pebbles of Hermus;\\n\\nHaste, oh! haste thee away, nor blush to behave like a coward.\\n\\nOf all the answers that had reached him, this pleased him far the\\nbest, for it seemed incredible that a mule should ever come to be\\nking of the Medes, and so he concluded that the sovereignty would\\nnever depart from himself or his seed after him. Afterwards he turned\\nhis thoughts to the alliance which he had been recommended to contract,\\nand sought to ascertain by inquiry which was the most powerful of\\nthe Grecian states. His inquiries pointed out to him two states as\\npre-eminent above the rest. These were the Lacedaemonians and the\\nAthenians, the former of Doric, the latter of Ionic blood. And indeed\\nthese two nations had held from very, early times the most distinguished\\nplace in Greece, the being a Pelasgic, the other a Hellenic people,\\nand the one having never quitted its original seats, while the other\\nhad been excessively migratory; for during the reign of Deucalion,\\nPhthiotis was the country in which the Hellenes dwelt, but under Dorus,\\nthe son of Hellen, they moved to the tract at the base of Ossa and\\nOlympus, which is called Histiaeotis; forced to retire from that region\\nby the Cadmeians, they settled, under the name of Macedni, in the\\nchain of Pindus. Hence they once more removed and came to Dryopis;\\nand from Dryopis having entered the Peloponnese in this way, they\\nbecame known as Dorians. \\n\\nWhat the language of the Pelasgi was I cannot say with any certainty.\\nIf, however, we may form a conjecture from the tongue spoken by the\\nPelasgi of the present day- those, for instance, who live at Creston\\nabove the Tyrrhenians, who formerly dwelt in the district named Thessaliotis,\\nand were neighbours of the people now called the Dorians- or those\\nagain who founded Placia and Scylace upon the Hellespont, who had\\npreviously dwelt for some time with the Athenians- or those, in short,\\nof any other of the cities which have dropped the name but are in\\nfact Pelasgian; if, I say, we are to form a conjecture from any of\\nthese, we must pronounce that the Pelasgi spoke a barbarous language.\\nIf this were really so, and the entire Pelasgic race spoke the same\\ntongue, the Athenians, who were certainly Pelasgi, must have changed\\ntheir language at the same time that they passed into the Hellenic\\nbody; for it is a certain fact that the people of Creston speak a\\nlanguage unlike any of their neighbours, and the same is true of the\\nPlacianians, while the language spoken by these two people is the\\nsame; which shows that they both retain the idiom which they brought\\nwith them into the countries where they are now settled.\\n\\nThe Hellenic race has never, since its first origin, changed its speech.\\nThis at least seems evident to me. It was a branch of the Pelasgic,\\nwhich separated from the main body, and at first was scanty in numbers\\nand of little power; but it gradually spread and increased to a multitude\\nof nations, chiefly by the voluntary entrance into its ranks of numerous\\ntribes of barbarians. The Pelasgi, on the other hand, were, as I think,\\na barbarian race which never greatly multiplied. \\n\\nOn inquiring into the condition of these two nations, Croesus found\\nthat one, the Athenian, was in a state of grievous oppression and\\ndistraction under Pisistratus, the son of Hippocrates, who was at\\nthat time tyrant of Athens. Hippocrates, when he was a private citizen,\\nis said to have gone once upon a time to Olympia to see the Games,\\nwhen a wonderful prodigy happened to him. As he was employed in sacrificing,\\nthe cauldrons which stood near, full of water and of the flesh of\\nthe victims, began to boil without the help of fire, so that the water\\noverflowed the pots. Chilon the Lacedaemonian, who happened to be\\nthere and to witness the prodigy, advised Hippocrates, if he were\\nunmarried, never to take into his house a wife who could bear him\\na child; if he already had one, to send her back to her friends; if\\nhe had a son, to disown him. Chilon\\'s advice did not at all please\\nHippocrates, who disregarded it, and some time after became the father\\nof Pisistratus. This Pisistratus, at a time when there was civil contention\\nin Attica between the party of the Sea-coast headed by Megacles the\\nson of Alcmaeon, and that of the Plain headed by Lycurgus, one of\\nthe Aristolaids, formed the project of making himself tyrant, and\\nwith this view created a third party. Gathering together a band of\\npartisans, and giving himself out for the protector of the Highlanders,\\nhe contrived the following stratagem. He wounded himself and his mules,\\nand then drove his chariot into the market-place, professing to have\\njust escaped an attack of his enemies, who had attempted his life\\nas he was on his way into the country. He besought the people to assign\\nhim a guard to protect his person, reminding them of the glory which\\nhe had gained when he led the attack upon the Megarians, and took\\nthe town of Nisaea, at the same time performing many other exploits.\\nThe Athenians, deceived by his story, appointed him a band of citizens\\nto serve as a guard, who were to carry clubs instead of spears, and\\nto accompany him wherever he went. Thus strengthened, Pisistratus\\nbroke into revolt and seized the citadel. In this way he acquired\\nthe sovereignty of Athens, which he continued to hold without disturbing\\nthe previously existing offices or altering any of the laws. He administered\\nthe state according to the established usages, and his arrangements\\nwere wise and salutary. \\n\\nHowever, after a little time, the partisans of Megacles and those\\nof Lycurgus agreed to forget their differences, and united to drive\\nhim out. So Pisistratus, having by the means described first made\\nhimself master of Athens, lost his power again before it had time\\nto take root. No sooner, however, was he departed than the factions\\nwhich had driven him out quarrelled anew, and at last Megacles, wearied\\nwith the struggle, sent a herald to Pisistratus, with an offer to\\nre-establish him on the throne if he would marry his daughter. Pisistratus\\nconsented, and on these terms an agreement was concluded between the\\ntwo, after which they proceeded to devise the mode of his restoration.\\nAnd here the device on which they hit was the silliest that I find\\non record, more especially considering that the Greeks have been from\\nvery ancient times distinguished from the barbarians by superior sagacity\\nand freedom from foolish simpleness, and remembering that the persons\\non whom this trick was played were not only Greeks but Athenians,\\nwho have the credit of surpassing all other Greeks in cleverness.\\nThere was in the Paeanian district a woman named Phya, whose height\\nonly fell short of four cubits by three fingers\\' breadth, and who\\nwas altogether comely to look upon. This woman they clothed in complete\\narmour, and, instructing her as to the carriage which she was to maintain\\nin order to beseem her part, they placed her in a chariot and drove\\nto the city. Heralds had been sent forward to precede her, and to\\nmake proclamation to this effect: \"Citizens of Athens, receive again\\nPisistratus with friendly minds. Minerva, who of all men honours him\\nthe most, herself conducts him back to her own citadel.\" This they\\nproclaimed in all directions, and immediately the rumour spread throughout\\nthe country districts that Minerva was bringing back her favourite.\\nThey of the city also, fully persuaded that the woman was the veritable\\ngoddess, prostrated themselves before her, and received Pisistratus\\nback. \\n\\nPisistratus, having thus recovered the sovereignty, married, according\\nto agreement, the daughter of Megacles. As, however, he had already\\na family of grown up sons, and the Alcmaeonidae were supposed to be\\nunder a curse, he determined that there should be no issue of the\\nmarriage. His wife at first kept this matter to herself, but after\\na time, either her mother questioned her, or it may be that she told\\nit of her own accord. At any rate, she informed her mother, and so\\nit reached her father\\'s ears. Megacles, indignant at receiving an\\naffront from such a quarter, in his anger instantly made up his differences\\nwith the opposite faction, on which Pisistratus, aware of what was\\nplanning against him, took himself out of the country. Arrived at\\nEretria, he held a council with his children to decide what was to\\nbe done. The opinion of Hippias prevailed, and it was agreed to aim\\nat regaining the sovereignty. The first step was to obtain advances\\nof money from such states as were under obligations to them. By these\\nmeans they collected large sums from several countries, especially\\nfrom the Thebans, who gave them far more than any of the rest. To\\nbe brief, time passed, and all was at length got ready for their return.\\nA band of Argive mercenaries arrived from the Peloponnese, and a certain\\nNaxian named Lygdamis, who volunteered his services, was particularly\\nzealous in the cause, supplying both men and money. \\n\\nIn the eleventh year of their exile the family of Pisistratus set\\nsail from Eretria on their return home. They made the coast of Attica,\\nnear Marathon, where they encamped, and were joined by their partisans\\nfrom the capital and by numbers from the country districts, who loved\\ntyranny better than freedom. At Athens, while Pisistratus was obtaining\\nfunds, and even after he landed at Marathon, no one paid any attention\\nto his proceedings. When, however, it became known that he had left\\nMarathon, and was marching upon the city, preparations were made for\\nresistance, the whole force of the state was levied, and led against\\nthe returning exiles. Meantime the army of Pisistratus, which had\\nbroken up from Marathon, meeting their adversaries near the temple\\nof the Pallenian Minerva, pitched their camp opposite them. Here a\\ncertain soothsayer, Amphilytus by name, an Acarnanian, moved by a\\ndivine impulse, came into the presence of Pisistratus, and approaching\\nhim uttered this prophecy in the hexameter measure:- \\n\\nNow has the cast been made, the net is out-spread in the water,\\n\\nThrough the moonshiny night the tunnies will enter the meshes.\\n\\nSuch was the prophecy uttered under a divine inspiration. Pisistratus,\\napprehending its meaning, declared that he accepted the oracle, and\\ninstantly led on his army. The Athenians from the city had just finished\\ntheir midday meal, after which they had betaken themselves, some to\\ndice, others to sleep, when Pisistratus with his troops fell upon\\nthem and put them to the rout. As soon as the flight began, Pisistratus\\nbethought himself of a most wise contrivance, whereby the might be\\ninduced to disperse and not unite in a body any more. He mounted his\\nsons on horseback and sent them on in front to overtake the fugitives,\\nand exhort them to be of good cheer, and return each man to his home.\\nThe Athenians took the advice, and Pisistratus became for the third\\ntime master of Athens. \\n\\nUpon this he set himself to root his power more firmly, by the aid\\nof a numerous body of mercenaries, and by keeping up a full exchequer,\\npartly supplied from native sources, partly from the countries about\\nthe river Strymon. He also demanded hostages from many of the Athenians\\nwho had remained at home, and not left Athens at his approach; and\\nthese he sent to Naxos, which he had conquered by force of arms, and\\ngiven over into the charge of Lygdamis. Farther, he purified the island\\nof Delos, according to the injunctions of an oracle, after the following\\nfashion. All the dead bodies which had been interred within sight\\nof the temple he dug up, and removed to another part of the isle.\\nThus was the tyranny of Pisistratus established at Athens, many of\\nthe Athenians having fallen in the battle, and many others having\\nfled the country together with the son of Alcmaeon. \\n\\nSuch was the condition of the Athenians when Croesus made inquiry\\nconcerning them. Proceeding to seek information concerning the Lacedaemonians,\\nhe learnt that, after passing through a period of great depression,\\nthey had lately been victorious in a war with the people of Tegea;\\nfor, during the joint reign of Leo and Agasicles, kings of Sparta,\\nthe Lacedaemonians, successful in all their other wars, suffered continual\\ndefeat at the hands of the Tegeans. At a still earlier period they\\nhad been the very worst governed people in Greece, as well in matters\\nof internal management as in their relations towards foreigners, from\\nwhom they kept entirely aloof. The circumstances which led to their\\nbeing well governed were the following:- Lycurgus, a man of distinction\\namong the Spartans, had gone to Delphi, to visit the oracle. Scarcely\\nhad he entered into the inner fane, when the Pythoness exclaimed aloud,\\n\\nOh! thou great Lycurgus, that com\\'st to my beautiful dwelling,\\n\\nDear to love, and to all who sit in the halls of Olympus,\\n\\nWhether to hail thee a god I know not, or only a mortal,\\n\\nBut my hope is strong that a god thou wilt prove, Lycurgus. Some report\\nbesides, that the Pythoness delivered to him the entire system of\\nlaws which are still observed by the Spartans. The Lacedaemonians,\\nhowever. themselves assert that Lycurgus, when he was guardian of\\nhis nephew, Labotas, king of Sparta, and regent in his room, introduced\\nthem from Crete; for as soon as he became regent, he altered the whole\\nof the existing customs, substituting new ones, which he took care\\nshould be observed by all. After this he arranged whatever appertained\\nto war, establishing the Enomotiae, Triacades, and Syssitia, besides\\nwhich he instituted the senate,\\' and the ephoralty. Such was the way\\nin which the Lacedaemonians became a well-governed people.\\n\\nOn the death of Lycurgus they built him a temple, and ever since they\\nhave worshipped him with the utmost reverence. Their soil being good\\nand the population numerous, they sprang up rapidly to power, and\\nbecame a flourishing people. In consequence they soon ceased to be\\nsatisfied to stay quiet; and, regarding the Arcadians as very much\\ntheir inferiors, they sent to consult the oracle about conquering\\nthe whole of Arcadia. The Pythoness thus answered them: \\n\\nCravest thou Arcady? Bold is thy craving. I shall not content it.\\n\\nMany the men that in Arcady dwell, whose food is the acorn-\\n\\nThey will never allow thee. It is not I that am niggard.\\n\\nI will give thee to dance in Tegea, with noisy foot-fall,\\n\\nAnd with the measuring line mete out the glorious champaign. When\\nthe Lacedaemonians received this reply, leaving the rest of Arcadia\\nuntouched, they marched against the Tegeans, carrying with them fetters,\\nso confident had this oracle (which was, in truth, but of base metal)\\nmade them that they would enslave the Tegeans. The battle, however,\\nwent against them, and many fell into the enemy\\'s hands. Then these\\npersons, wearing the fetters which they had themselves brought, and\\nfastened together in a string, measured the Tegean plain as they executed\\ntheir labours. The fetters in which they worked were still, in my\\nday, preserved at Tegea where they hung round the walls of the temple\\nof Minerva Alea. \\n\\nThroughout the whole of this early contest with the Tegeans, the Lacedaemonians\\nmet with nothing but defeats; but in the time of Croesus, under the\\nkings Anaxandrides and Aristo, fortune had turned in their favour,\\nin the manner which I will now relate. Having been worsted in every\\nengagement by their enemy, they sent to Delphi, and inquired of the\\noracle what god they must propitiate to prevail in the war against\\nthe Tegeans. The answer of the Pythoness was that before they could\\nprevail, they must remove to Sparta the bones of Orestes, the son\\nof Agamemnon. Unable to discover his burial-place, they sent a second\\ntime, and asked the god where the body of the hero had been laid.\\nThe following was the answer they received:- \\n\\nLevel and smooth is the plain where Arcadian Tegea standeth;\\n\\nThere two winds are ever, by strong necessity, blowing, \\nCounter-stroke answers stroke, and evil lies upon evil. \\nThere all-teeming Earth doth harbour the son of Atrides;\\n\\nBring thou him to thy city, and then be Tegea\\'s master. After this\\nreply, the Lacedaemonians were no nearer discovering the burial-place\\nthan before, though they continued to search for it diligently; until\\nat last a man named Lichas, one of the Spartans called Agathoergi,\\nfound it. The Agathoergi are citizens who have just served their time\\namong the knights. The five eldest of the knights go out every year,\\nand are bound during the year after their discharge to go wherever\\nthe State sends them, and actively employ themselves in its service.\\n\\nLichas was one of this body when, partly by good luck, partly by his\\nown wisdom, he discovered the burial-place. Intercourse between the\\ntwo States existing just at this time, he went to Tegea, and, happening\\nto enter into the workshop of a smith, he saw him forging some iron.\\nAs he stood marvelling at what he beheld, he was observed by the smith\\nwho, leaving off his work, went up to him and said, \\n\\n\"Certainly, then, you Spartan stranger, you would have been wonderfully\\nsurprised if you had seen what I have, since you make a marvel even\\nof the working in iron. I wanted to make myself a well in this room,\\nand began to dig it, when what think you? I came upon a coffin seven\\ncubits long. I had never believed that men were taller in the olden\\ntimes than they are now, so I opened the coffin. The body inside was\\nof the same length: I measured it, and filled up the hole again.\"\\n\\nSuch was the man\\'s account of what he had seen. The other, on turning\\nthe matter over in his mind, conjectured that this was the body of\\nOrestes, of which the oracle had spoken. He guessed so, because he\\nobserved that the smithy had two bellows, which he understood to be\\nthe two winds, and the hammer and anvil would do for the stroke and\\nthe counterstroke, and the iron that was being wrought for the evil\\nlying upon evil. This he imagined might be so because iron had been\\ndiscovered to the hurt of man. Full of these conjectures, he sped\\nback to Sparta and laid the whole matter before his countrymen. Soon\\nafter, by a concerted plan, they brought a charge against him, and\\nbegan a prosecution. Lichas betook himself to Tegea, and on his arrival\\nacquainted the smith with his misfortune, and proposed to rent his\\nroom of him. The smith refused for some time; but at last Lichas persuaded\\nhim, and took up his abode in it. Then he opened the grave, and collecting\\nthe bones, returned with them to Sparta. From henceforth, whenever\\nthe Spartans and the Tegeans made trial of each other\\'s skill in arms,\\nthe Spartans always had greatly the advantage; and by the time to\\nwhich we are now come they were masters of most of the Peloponnese.\\n\\nCroesus, informed of all these circumstances, sent messengers to Sparta,\\nwith gifts in their hands, who were to ask the Spartans to enter into\\nalliance with him. They received strict injunctions as to what they\\nshould say, and on their arrival at Sparta spake as follows:-\\n\\n\"Croesus, king of the Lydians and of other nations, has sent us to\\nspeak thus to you: \\'Oh Lacedaemonians, the god has bidden me to make\\nthe Greek my friend; I therefore apply to you, in conformity with\\nthe oracle, knowing that you hold the first rank in Greece, and desire\\nto become your friend and ally in all true faith and honesty.\\'\"\\n\\nSuch was the message which Croesus sent by his heralds. The Lacedaemonians,\\nwho were aware beforehand of the reply given him by the oracle, were\\nfull of joy at the coming of the messengers, and at once took the\\noaths of friendship and alliance: this they did the more readily as\\nthey had previously contracted certain obligations towards him. They\\nhad sent to Sardis on one occasion to purchase some gold, intending\\nto use it on a statue of Apollo- the statue, namely, which remains\\nto this day at Thornax in Laconia, when Croesus, hearing of the matter,\\ngave them as a gift the gold which they wanted. \\n\\nThis was one reason why the Lacedaemonians were so willing to make\\nthe alliance: another was, because Croesus had chosen them for his\\nfriends in preference to all the other Greeks. They therefore held\\nthemselves in readiness to come at his summons, and not content with\\nso doing, they further had a huge vase made in bronze, covered with\\nfigures of animals all round the outside of the rim, and large enough\\nto contain three hundred amphorae, which they sent to Croesus as a\\nreturn for his presents to them. The vase, however, never reached\\nSardis. Its miscarriage is accounted for in two quite different ways.\\nThe Lacedaemonian story is that when it reached Samos, on its way\\ntowards Sardis, the Samians having knowledge of it, put to sea in\\ntheir ships of war and made it their prize. But the Samians declare\\nthat the Lacedaemonians who had the vase in charge, happening to arrive\\ntoo late, and learning that Sardis had fallen and that Croesus was\\na prisoner, sold it in their island, and the purchasers (who were,\\nthey say, private persons) made an offering of it at the shrine of\\nJuno: the sellers were very likely on their return to Sparta to have\\nsaid that they had been robbed of it by the Samians. Such, then, was\\nthe fate of the vase. \\n\\nMeanwhile Croesus, taking the oracle in a wrong sense, led his forces\\ninto Cappadocia, fully expecting to defeat Cyrus and destroy the empire\\nof the Persians. While he was still engaged in making preparations\\nfor his attack, a Lydian named Sandanis, who had always been looked\\nupon as a wise man, but who after this obtained a very great name\\nindeed among his countrymen, came forward and counselled the king\\nin these words: \\n\\n\"Thou art about, oh! king, to make war against men who wear leathern\\ntrousers, and have all their other garments of leather; who feed not\\non what they like, but on what they can get from a soil that is sterile\\nand unkindly; who do not indulge in wine, but drink water; who possess\\nno figs nor anything else that is good to eat. If, then, thou conquerest\\nthem, what canst thou get from them, seeing that they have nothing\\nat all? But if they conquer thee, consider how much that is precious\\nthou wilt lose: if they once get a taste of our pleasant things, they\\nwill keep such hold of them that we shall never be able to make them\\nloose their grasp. For my part, I am thankful to the gods that they\\nhave not put it into the hearts of the Persians to invade Lydia.\"\\n\\nCroesus was not persuaded by this speech, though it was true enough;\\nfor before the conquest of Lydia, the Persians possessed none of the\\nluxuries or delights of life. \\n\\nThe Cappadocians are known to the Greeks by the name of Syrians. Before\\nthe rise of the Persian power, they had been subject to the Medes;\\nbut at the present time they were within the empire of Cyrus, for\\nthe boundary between the Median and the Lydian empires was the river\\nHalys. This stream, which rises in the mountain country of Armenia,\\nruns first through Cilicia; afterwards it flows for a while with the\\nMatieni on the right, and the Phrygians on the left: then, when they\\nare passed, it proceeds with a northern course, separating the Cappadocian\\nSyrians from the Paphlagonians, who occupy the left bank, thus forming\\nthe boundary of almost the whole of Lower Asia, from the sea opposite\\nCyprus to the Euxine. Just there is the neck of the peninsula, a journey\\nof five days across for an active walker. \\n\\nThere were two motives which led Croesus to attack Cappadocia: firstly,\\nhe coveted the land, which he wished to add to his own dominions;\\nbut the chief reason was that he wanted to revenge on Cyrus the wrongs\\nof Astyages, and was made confident by the oracle of being able so\\nto do: for Astyages, son of Cyaxares and king of the Medes, who had\\nbeen dethroned by Cyrus, son of Cambyses, was Croesus\\' brother by\\nmarriage. This marriage had taken place under circumstances which\\nI will now relate. A band of Scythian nomads, who had left their own\\nland on occasion of some disturbance, had taken refuge in Media. Cyaxares,\\nson of Phraortes, and grandson of Deioces, was at that time king of\\nthe country. Recognising them as suppliants, he began by treating\\nthem with kindness, and coming presently to esteem them highly, he\\nintrusted to their care a number of boys, whom they were to teach\\ntheir language and to instruct in the use of the bow. Time passed,\\nand the Scythians employed themselves, day after day, in hunting,\\nand always brought home some game; but at last it chanced that one\\nday they took nothing. On their return to Cyaxares with empty hands,\\nthat monarch, who was hot-tempered, as he showed upon the occasion,\\nreceived them very rudely and insultingly. In consequence of this\\ntreatment, which they did not conceive themselves to have deserved,\\nthe Scythians determined to take one of the boys whom they had in\\ncharge, cut him in pieces, and then dressing the flesh as they were\\nwont to dress that of the wild animals, serve it up to Cyaxares as\\ngame: after which they resolved to convey themselves with all speed\\nto Sardis, to the court of Alyattes, the son of Sadyattes. The plan\\nwas carried out: Cyaxares and his guests ate of the flesh prepared\\nby the Scythians, and they themselves, having accomplished their purpose,\\nfled to Alyattes in the guise of suppliants. \\n\\nAfterwards, on the refusal of Alyattes to give up his suppliants when\\nCyaxares sent to demand them of him, war broke out between the Lydians\\nand the Medes, and continued for five years, with various success.\\nIn the course of it the Medes gained many victories over the Lydians,\\nand the Lydians also gained many victories over the Medes. Among their\\nother battles there was one night engagement. As, however, the balance\\nhad not inclined in favour of either nation, another combat took place\\nin the sixth year, in the course of which, just as the battle was\\ngrowing warm, day was on a sudden changed into night. This event had\\nbeen foretold by Thales, the Milesian, who forewarned the Ionians\\nof it, fixing for it the very year in which it actually took place.\\nThe Medes and Lydians, when they observed the change, ceased fighting,\\nand were alike anxious to have terms of peace agreed on. Syennesis\\nof Cilicia, and Labynetus of Babylon, were the persons who mediated\\nbetween the parties, who hastened the taking of the oaths, and brought\\nabout the exchange of espousals. It was they who advised that Alyattes\\nshould give his daughter Aryenis in marriage to Astyages, the son\\nof Cyaxares, knowing, as they did, that without some sure bond of\\nstrong necessity, there is wont to be but little security in men\\'s\\ncovenants. Oaths are taken by these people in the same way as by the\\nGreeks, except that they make a slight flesh wound in their arms,\\nfrom which each sucks a portion of the other\\'s blood. \\n\\nCyrus had captured this Astyages, who was his mother\\'s father, and\\nkept him prisoner, for a reason which I shall bring forward in another\\nof my history. This capture formed the ground of quarrel between Cyrus\\nand Croesus, in consequence of which Croesus sent his servants to\\nask the oracle if he should attack the Persians; and when an evasive\\nanswer came, fancying it to be in his favour, carried his arms into\\nthe Persian territory. When he reached the river Halys, he transported\\nhis army across it, as I maintain, by the bridges which exist there\\nat the present day; but, according to the general belief of the Greeks,\\nby the aid of Thales the Milesian. The tale is that Croesus was in\\ndoubt how he should get his army across, as the bridges were not made\\nat that time, and that Thales, who happened to be in the camp, divided\\nthe stream and caused it to flow on both sides of the army instead\\nof on the left only. This he effected thus:- Beginning some distance\\nabove the camp, he dug a deep channel, which he brought round in a\\nsemicircle, so that it might pass to rearward of the camp; and that\\nthus the river, diverted from its natural course into the new channel\\nat the point where this left the stream, might flow by the station\\nof the army, and afterwards fall again into the ancient bed. In this\\nway the river was split into two streams, which were both easily fordable.\\nIt is said by some that the water was entirely drained off from the\\nnatural bed of the river. But I am of a different opinion; for I do\\nnot see how, in that case, they could have crossed it on their return.\\n\\nHaving passed the Halys with the forces under his command, Croesus\\nentered the district of Cappadocia which is called Pteria. It lies\\nin the neighbourhood of the city of Sinope upon the Euxine, and is\\nthe strongest position in the whole country thereabouts. Here Croesus\\npitched his camp, and began to ravage the fields of the Syrians. He\\nbesieged and took the chief city of the Pterians, and reduced the\\ninhabitants to slavery: he likewise made himself master of the surrounding\\nvillages. Thus he brought ruin on the Syrians, who were guilty of\\nno offence towards him. Meanwhile, Cyrus had levied an army and marched\\nagainst Croesus, increasing his numbers at every step by the forces\\nof the nations that lay in his way. Before beginning his march he\\nhad sent heralds to the Ionians, with an invitation to them to revolt\\nfrom the Lydian king: they, however, had refused compliance. Cyrus,\\nnotwithstanding, marched against the enemy, and encamped opposite\\nthem in the district of Pteria, where the trial of strength took place\\nbetween the contending powers. The combat was hot and bloody, and\\nupon both sides the number of the slain was great; nor had victory\\ndeclared in favour of either party, when night came down upon the\\nbattle-field. Thus both armies fought valiantly. \\n\\nCroesus laid the blame of his ill success on the number of his troops,\\nwhich fell very short of the enemy; and as on the next day Cyrus did\\nnot repeat the attack, he set off on his return to Sardis, intending\\nto collect his allies and renew the contest in the spring. He meant\\nto call on the Egyptians to send him aid, according to the terms of\\nthe alliance which he had concluded with Amasis, previously to his\\nleague with the Lacedaemonians. He intended also to summon to his\\nassistance the Babylonians, under their king Labynetus, for they too\\nwere bound to him by treaty: and further, he meant to send word to\\nSparta, and appoint a day for the coming of their succours. Having\\ngot together these forces in addition to his own, he would, as soon\\nas the winter was past and springtime come, march once more against\\nthe Persians. With these intentions Croesus, immediately on his return,\\ndespatched heralds to his various allies, with a request that they\\nwould join him at Sardis in the course of the fifth month from the\\ntime of the departure of his messengers. He then disbanded the army\\nconsisting of mercenary troops- which had been engaged with the Persians\\nand had since accompanied him to his capital, and let them depart\\nto their homes, never imagining that Cyrus, after a battle in which\\nvictory had been so evenly balanced, would venture to march upon Sardis.\\n\\nWhile Croesus was still in this mind, all the suburbs of Sardis were\\nfound to swarm with snakes, on the appearance of which the horses\\nleft feeding in the pasture-grounds, and flocked to the suburbs to\\neat them. The king, who witnessed the unusual sight, regarded it very\\nrightly as a prodigy. He therefore instantly sent messengers to the\\nsoothsayers of Telmessus, to consult them upon the matter, His messengers\\nreached the city, and obtained from the Telmessians an explanation\\nof what the prodigy portended, but fate did not allow them to inform\\ntheir lord; for ere they entered Sardis on their return, Croesus was\\na prisoner. What the Telmessians had declared was that Croesus must\\nlook for the entry of an army of foreign invaders into his country,\\nand that when they came they would subdue the native inhabitants;\\nsince the snake, said they, is a child of earth, and the horse a warrior\\nand a foreigner. Croesus was already a prisoner when the Telmessians\\nthus answered his inquiry, but they had no knowledge of what was taking\\nplace at Sardis, or of the fate of the monarch. \\n\\nCyrus, however, when Croesus broke up so suddenly from his quarters\\nafter the battle at Pteria, conceiving that he had marched away with\\nthe intention of disbanding his army, considered a little, and soon\\nsaw that it was advisable for him to advance upon Sardis with all\\nhaste, before the Lydians could get their forces together a second\\ntime. Having thus determined, he lost no time in carrying out his\\nplan. He marched forward with such speed that he was himself the first\\nto announce his coming to the Lydian king. That monarch, placed in\\nthe utmost difficulty by the turn of events which had gone so entirely\\nagainst all his calculations, nevertheless led out the Lydians to\\nbattle. In all Asia there was not at that time a braver or more warlike\\npeople. Their manner of fighting was on horseback; they carried long\\nlances, and were clever in the management of their steeds.\\n\\nThe two armies met in the plain before Sardis. It is a vast flat,\\nbare of trees, watered by the Hyllus and a number of other streams,\\nwhich all flow into one larger than the rest, called the Hermus. This\\nriver rises in the sacred mountain of the Dindymenian Mother, and\\nfalls into the sea near the town of Phocaea. \\n\\nWhen Cyrus beheld the Lydians arranging themselves in order of battle\\non this plain, fearful of the strength of their cavalry, he adopted\\na device which Harpagus, one of the Medes, suggested to him. He collected\\ntogether all the camels that had come in the train of his army to\\ncarry the provisions and the baggage, and taking off their loads,\\nhe mounted riders upon them accoutred as horsemen. These he commanded\\nto advance in front of his other troops against the Lydian horse;\\nbehind them were to follow the foot soldiers, and last of all the\\ncavalry. When his arrangements were complete, he gave his troops orders\\nto slay all the other Lydians who came in their way without mercy,\\nbut to spare Croesus and not kill him, even if he should be seized\\nand offer resistance. The reason why Cyrus opposed his camels to the\\nenemy\\'s horse was because the horse has a natural dread of the camel,\\nand cannot abide either the sight or the smell of that animal. By\\nthis stratagem he hoped to make Croesus\\'s horse useless to him, the\\nhorse being what he chiefly depended on for victory. The two armies\\nthen joined battle, and immediately the Lydian war-horses, seeing\\nand smelling the camels, turned round and galloped off; and so it\\ncame to pass that all Croesus\\'s hopes withered away. The Lydians,\\nhowever, behaved manfully. As soon as they understood what was happening,\\nthey leaped off their horses, and engaged with the Persians on foot.\\nThe combat was long; but at last, after a great slaughter on both\\nsides, the Lydians turned and fled. They were driven within their\\nwalls and the Persians laid siege to Sardis. \\n\\nThus the siege began. Meanwhile Croesus, thinking that the place would\\nhold out no inconsiderable time, sent off fresh heralds to his allies\\nfrom the beleaguered town. His former messengers had been charged\\nto bid them assemble at Sardis in the course of the fifth month; they\\nwhom he now sent were to say that he was already besieged, and to\\nbeseech them to come to his aid with all possible speed. Among his\\nother allies Croesus did not omit to send to Lacedaemon.\\n\\nIt chanced, however, that the Spartans were themselves just at this\\ntime engaged in a quarrel with the Argives about a place called Thyrea,\\nwhich was within the limits of Argolis, but had been seized on by\\nthe Lacedaemonians. Indeed, the whole country westward, as far as\\nCape Malea, belonged once to the Argives, and not only that entire\\ntract upon the mainland, but also Cythera, and the other islands.\\nThe Argives collected troops to resist the seizure of Thyrea, but\\nbefore any battle was fought, the two parties came to terms, and it\\nwas agreed that three hundred Spartans and three hundred Argives should\\nmeet and fight for the place, which should belong to the nation with\\nwhom the victory rested. It was stipulated also that the other troops\\non each side should return home to their respective countries, and\\nnot remain to witness the combat, as there was danger, if the armies\\nstayed, that either the one or the other, on seeing their countrymen\\nundergoing defeat, might hasten to their assistance. These terms being\\nagreed on, the two armies marched off, leaving three hundred picked\\nmen on each side to fight for the territory. The battle began, and\\nso equal were the combatants, that at the close of the day, when night\\nput a stop to the fight, of the whole six hundred only three men remained\\nalive, two Argives, Alcanor and Chromius, and a single Spartan, Othryadas.\\nThe two Argives, regarding themselves as the victors, hurried to Argos.\\nOthryadas, the Spartan, remained upon the field, and, stripping the\\nbodies of the Argives who had fallen, carried their armour to the\\nSpartan camp. Next day the two armies returned to learn the result.\\nAt first they disputed, both parties claiming the victory, the one,\\nbecause they had the greater number of survivors; the other, because\\ntheir man remained on the field, and stripped the bodies of the slain,\\nwhereas the two men of the other side ran away; but at last they fell\\nfrom words to blows, and a battle was fought, in which both parties\\nsuffered great loss, but at the end the Lacedaemonians gained the\\nvictory. Upon this the Argives, who up to that time had worn their\\nhair long, cut it off close, and made a law, to which they attached\\na curse, binding themselves never more to let their hair grow, and\\nnever to allow their women to wear gold, until they should recover\\nThyrea. At the same time the Lacedaemonians made a law the very reverse\\nof this, namely, to wear their hair long, though they had always before\\ncut it close. Othryadas himself, it is said, the sole survivor of\\nthe three hundred, prevented by a sense of shame from returning to\\nSparta after all his comrades had fallen, laid violent hands upon\\nhimself in Thyrea. \\n\\nAlthough the Spartans were engaged with these matters when the herald\\narrived from Sardis to entreat them to come to the assistance of the\\nbesieged king, yet, notwithstanding, they instantly set to work to\\nafford him help. They had completed their preparations, and the ships\\nwere just ready to start, when a second message informed them that\\nthe place had already fallen, and that Croesus was a prisoner. Deeply\\ngrieved at his misfortune, the Spartans ceased their efforts.\\n\\nThe following is the way in which Sardis was taken. On the fourteenth\\nday of the siege Cyrus bade some horsemen ride about his lines, and\\nmake proclamation to the whole army that he would give a reward to\\nthe man who should first mount the wall. After this he made an assault,\\nbut without success. His troops retired, but a certain Mardian, Hyroeades\\nby name, resolved to approach the citadel and attempt it at a place\\nwhere no guards were ever set. On this side the rock was so precipitous,\\nand the citadel (as it seemed) so impregnable, that no fear was entertained\\nof its being carried in this place. Here was the only portion of the\\ncircuit round which their old king Meles did not carry the lion which\\nhis leman bore to him. For when the Telmessians had declared that\\nif the lion were taken round the defences, Sardis would be impregnable,\\nand Meles, in consequence, carried it round the rest of the fortress\\nwhere the citadel seemed open to attack, he scorned to take it round\\nthis side, which he looked on as a sheer precipice, and therefore\\nabsolutely secure. It is on that side of the city which faces Mount\\nTmolus. Hyroeades, however, having the day before observed a Lydian\\nsoldier descend the rock after a helmet that had rolled down from\\nthe top, and having seen him pick it up and carry it back, thought\\nover what he had witnessed, and formed his plan. He climbed the rock\\nhimself, and other Persians followed in his track, until a large number\\nhad mounted to the top. Thus was Sardis taken, and given up entirely\\nto pillage. \\n\\nWith respect to Croesus himself, this is what befell him at the taking\\nof the town. He had a son, of whom I made mention above, a worthy\\nyouth, whose only defect was that he was deaf and dumb. In the days\\nof his prosperity Croesus had done the utmost that be could for him,\\nand among other plans which he had devised, had sent to Delphi to\\nconsult the oracle on his behalf. The answer which he had received\\nfrom the Pythoness ran thus:- \\n\\nLydian, wide-ruling monarch, thou wondrous simple Croesus,\\n\\nWish not ever to hear in thy palace the voice thou hast prayed for\\n\\nUttering intelligent sounds. Far better thy son should be silent!\\n\\nAh! woe worth the day when thine car shall first list to his\\n\\naccents. \\n\\nWhen the town was taken, one of the Persians was just going to kill\\nCroesus, not knowing who he was. Croesus saw the man coming, but under\\nthe pressure of his affliction, did not care to avoid the blow, not\\nminding whether or no he died beneath the stroke. Then this son of\\nhis, who was voiceless, beholding the Persian as he rushed towards\\nCroesus, in the agony of his fear and grief burst into speech, and\\nsaid, \"Man, do not kill Croesus.\" This was the first time that he\\nhad ever spoken a word, but afterwards he retained the power of speech\\nfor the remainder of his life. \\n\\nThus was Sardis taken by the Persians, and Croesus himself fell into\\ntheir hands, after having reigned fourteen years, and been besieged\\nin his capital fourteen days; thus too did Croesus fulfill the oracle,\\nwhich said that he should destroy a mighty empire by destroying his\\nown. Then the Persians who had made Croesus prisoner brought him before\\nCyrus. Now a vast pile had been raised by his orders, and Croesus,\\nladen with fetters, was placed upon it, and with him twice seven of\\nthe sons of the Lydians. I know not whether Cyrus was minded to make\\nan offering of the to some god or other, or whether he had vowed a\\nvow and was performing it, or whether, as may well be, he had heard\\nthat Croesus was a holy man, and so wished to see if any of the heavenly\\npowers would appear to save him from being burnt alive. However it\\nmight be, Cyrus was thus engaged, and Croesus was already on the pile,\\nwhen it entered his mind in the depth of his woe that there was a\\ndivine warning in the words which had come to him from the lips of\\nSolon, \"No one while he lives is happy.\" When this thought smote him\\nhe fetched a long breath, and breaking his deep silence, groaned out\\naloud, thrice uttering the name of Solon. Cyrus caught the sounds,\\nand bade the interpreters inquire of Croesus who it was he called\\non. They drew near and asked him, but he held his peace, and for a\\nlong time made no answer to their questionings, until at length, forced\\nto say something, he exclaimed, \"One I would give much to see converse\\nwith every monarch.\" Not knowing what he meant by this reply, the\\ninterpreters begged him to explain himself; and as they pressed for\\nan answer, and grew to be troublesome, he told them how, a long time\\nbefore, Solon, an Athenian, had come and seen all his splendour, and\\nmade light of it; and how whatever he had said to him had fallen out\\nexactly as he foreshowed, although it was nothing that especially\\nconcerned him, but applied to all mankind alike, and most to those\\nwho seemed to themselves happy. Meanwhile, as he thus spoke, the pile\\nwas lighted, and the outer portion began to blaze. Then Cyrus, hearing\\nfrom the interpreters what Croesus had said, relented, bethinking\\nhimself that he too was a man, and that it was a fellow-man, and one\\nwho had once been as blessed by fortune as himself, that he was burning\\nalive; afraid, moreover, of retribution, and full of the thought that\\nwhatever is human is insecure. So he bade them quench the blazing\\nfire as quickly as they could, and take down Croesus and the other\\nLydians, which they tried to do, but the flames were not to be mastered.\\n\\nThen, the Lydians say that Croesus, perceiving by the efforts made\\nto quench the fire that Cyrus had relented, and seeing also that all\\nwas in vain, and that the men could not get the fire under, called\\nwith a loud voice upon the god Apollo, and prayed him, if he ever\\nreceived at his hands any acceptable gift, to come to his aid, and\\ndeliver him from his present danger. As thus with tears he besought\\nthe god, suddenly, though up to that time the sky had been clear and\\nthe day without a breath of wind, dark clouds gathered, and the storm\\nburst over their heads with rain of such violence, that the flames\\nwere speedily extinguished. Cyrus, convinced by this that Croesus\\nwas a good man and a favourite of heaven, asked him after he was taken\\noff the pile, \"Who it was that had persuaded him to lead an army into\\nhis country, and so become his foe rather than continue his friend?\"\\nto which Croesus made answer as follows: \"What I did, oh! king, was\\nto thy advantage and to my own loss. If there be blame, it rests with\\nthe god of the Greeks, who encouraged me to begin the war. No one\\nis so foolish as to prefer war to peace, in which, instead of sons\\nburying their fathers, fathers bury their sons. But the gods willed\\nit so.\" \\n\\nThus did Croesus speak. Cyrus then ordered his fetters to be taken\\noff, and made him sit down near himself, and paid him much respect,\\nlooking upon him, as did also the courtiers, with a sort of wonder.\\nCroesus, wrapped in thought, uttered no word. After a while, happening\\nto turn and perceive the Persian soldiers engaged in plundering the\\ntown, he said to Cyrus, \"May I now tell thee, oh! king, what I have\\nin my mind, or is silence best?\" Cyrus bade him speak his mind boldly.\\nThen he put this question: \"What is it, oh! Cyrus, which those men\\nyonder are doing so busily?\" \"Plundering thy city,\" Cyrus answered,\\n\"and carrying off thy riches.\" \"Not my city,\" rejoined the other,\\n\"nor my riches. They are not mine any more. It is thy wealth which\\nthey are pillaging.\" \\n\\nCyrus, struck by what Croesus had said, bade all the court to withdraw,\\nand then asked Croesus what he thought it best for him to do as regarded\\nthe plundering. Croesus answered, \"Now that the gods have made me\\nthy slave, oh! Cyrus, it seems to me that it is my part, if I see\\nanything to thy advantage, to show it to thee. Thy subjects, the Persians,\\nare a poor people with a proud spirit. If then thou lettest them pillage\\nand possess themselves of great wealth, I will tell thee what thou\\nhast to expect at their hands. The man who gets the most, look to\\nhaving him rebel against thee. Now then, if my words please thee,\\ndo thus, oh! king:- Let some of thy bodyguards be placed as sentinels\\nat each of the city gates, and let them take their booty from the\\nsoldiers as they leave the town, and tell them that they do so because\\nthe tenths are due to Jupiter. So wilt thou escape the hatred they\\nwould feel if the plunder were taken away from them by force; and\\nthey, seeing that what is proposed is just, will do it willingly.\"\\n\\nCyrus was beyond measure pleased with this advice, so excellent did\\nit seem to him. He praised Croesus highly, and gave orders to his\\nbodyguard to do as he had suggested. Then, turning to Croesus, he\\nsaid, \"Oh! Croesus, I see that thou are resolved both in speech and\\nact to show thyself a virtuous prince: ask me, therefore, whatever\\nthou wilt as a gift at this moment.\" Croesus replied, \"Oh! my lord,\\nif thou wilt suffer me to send these fetters to the god of the Greeks,\\nwhom I once honoured above all other gods, and ask him if it is his\\nwont to deceive his benefactors- that will be the highest favour thou\\ncanst confer on me.\" Cyrus upon this inquired what charge he had to\\nmake against the god. Then Croesus gave him a full account of all\\nhis projects, and of the answers of the oracle, and of the offerings\\nwhich he had sent, on which he dwelt especially, and told him how\\nit was the encouragement given him by the oracle which had led him\\nto make war upon Persia. All this he related, and at the end again\\nbesought permission to reproach the god with his behaviour. Cyrus\\nanswered with a laugh, \"This I readily grant thee, and whatever else\\nthou shalt at any time ask at my hands.\" Croesus, finding his request\\nallowed, sent certain Lydians to Delphi, enjoining them to lay his\\nfetters upon the threshold of the temple, and ask the god, \"If he\\nwere not ashamed of having encouraged him, as the destined destroyer\\nof the empire of Cyrus, to begin a war with Persia, of which such\\nwere the first-fruits?\" As they said this they were to point to the\\nfetters- and further they were to inquire, \"If it was the wont of\\nthe Greek gods to be ungrateful?\" \\n\\nThe Lydians went to Delphi and delivered their message, on which the\\nPythoness is said to have replied- \"It is not possible even for a\\ngod to escape the decree of destiny. Croesus has been punished for\\nthe sin of his fifth ancestor, who, when he was one of the bodyguard\\nof the Heraclides, joined in a woman\\'s fraud, and, slaying his master,\\nwrongfully seized the throne. Apollo was anxious that the fall of\\nSardis should not happen in the lifetime of Croesus, but be delayed\\nto his son\\'s days; he could not, however, persuade the Fates. All\\nthat they were willing to allow he took and gave to Croesus. Let Croesus\\nknow that Apollo delayed the taking of Sardis three full years, and\\nthat he is thus a prisoner three years later than was his destiny.\\nMoreover it was Apollo who saved him from the burning pile. Nor has\\nCroesus any right to complain with respect to the oracular answer\\nwhich he received. For when the god told him that, if he attacked\\nthe Persians, he would destroy a mighty empire, he ought, if he had\\nbeen wise, to have sent again and inquired which empire was meant,\\nthat of Cyrus or his own; but if he neither understood what was said,\\nnor took the trouble to seek for enlightenment, he has only himself\\nto blame for the result. Besides, he had misunderstood the last answer\\nwhich had been given him about the mule. Cyrus was that mule. For\\nthe parents of Cyrus were of different races, and of different conditions-\\nhis mother a Median princess, daughter of King Astyages, and his father\\na Persian and a subject, who, though so far beneath her in all respects,\\nhad married his royal mistress.\" \\n\\nSuch was the answer of the Pythoness. The Lydians returned to Sardis\\nand communicated it to Croesus, who confessed, on hearing it, that\\nthe fault was his, not the god\\'s. Such was the way in which Ionia\\nwas first conquered, and so was the empire of Croesus brought to a\\nclose. \\n\\nBesides the offerings which have been already mentioned, there are\\nmany others in various parts of Greece presented by Croesus; as at\\nThebes in Boeotia, where there is a golden tripod, dedicated by him\\nto Ismenian Apollo; at Ephesus, where the golden heifers, and most\\nof the columns are his gift; and at Delphi, in the temple of Pronaia,\\nwhere there is a huge shield in gold, which he gave. All these offerings\\nwere still in existence in my day; many others have perished: among\\nthem those which he dedicated at Branchidae in Milesia, equal in weight,\\nas I am informed, and in all respects like to those at Delphi. The\\nDelphian presents, and those sent to Amphiaraus, came from his own\\nprivate property, being the first-fruits of the fortune which he inherited\\nfrom his father; his other offerings came from the riches of an enemy,\\nwho, before he mounted the throne, headed a party against him, with\\nthe view of obtaining the crown of Lydia for Pantaleon. This Pantaleon\\nwas a son of Alyattes, but by a different mother from Croesus; for\\nthe mother of Croesus was a Carian woman, but the mother of Pantaleon\\nan Ionian. When, by the appointment of his father, Croesus obtained\\nthe kingly dignity, he seized the man who had plotted against him,\\nand broke him upon the wheel. His property, which he had previously\\ndevoted to the service of the gods, Croesus applied in the way mentioned\\nabove. This is all I shall say about his offerings. \\n\\nLydia, unlike most other countries, scarcely offers any wonders for\\nthe historian to describe, except the gold-dust which is washed down\\nfrom the range of Tmolus. It has, however, one structure of enormous\\nsize, only inferior to the monuments of Egypt and Babylon. This is\\nthe tomb of Alyattes, the father of Croesus, the base of which is\\nformed of immense blocks of stone, the rest being a vast mound of\\nearth. It was raised by the joint labour of the tradesmen, handicraftsmen,\\nand courtesans of Sardis, and had at the top five stone pillars, which\\nremained to my day, with inscriptions cut on them, showing how much\\nof the work was done by each class of workpeople. It appeared on measurement\\nthat the portion of the courtesans was the largest. The daughters\\nof the common people in Lydia, one and all, pursue this traffic, wishing\\nto collect money for their portions. They continue the practice till\\nthey marry; and are wont to contract themselves in marriage. The tomb\\nis six stades and two plethra in circumference; its breadth is thirteen\\nplethra. Close to the tomb is a large lake, which the Lydians say\\nis never dry. They call it the Lake Gygaea. \\n\\nThe Lydians have very nearly the same customs as the Greeks, with\\nthe exception that these last do not bring up their girls in the same\\nway. So far as we have any knowledge, they were the first nation to\\nintroduce the use of gold and silver coin, and the first who sold\\ngoods by retail. They claim also the invention of all the games which\\nare common to them with the Greeks. These they declare that they invented\\nabout the time when they colonised Tyrrhenia, an event of which they\\ngive the following account. In the days of Atys, the son of Manes,\\nthere was great scarcity through the whole land of Lydia. For some\\ntime the Lydians bore the affliction patiently, but finding that it\\ndid not pass away, they set to work to devise remedies for the evil.\\nVarious expedients were discovered by various persons; dice, and huckle-bones,\\nand ball, and all such games were invented, except tables, the invention\\nof which they do not claim as theirs. The plan adopted against the\\nfamine was to engage in games one day so entirely as not to feel any\\ncraving for food, and the next day to eat and abstain from games.\\nIn this way they passed eighteen years. Still the affliction continued\\nand even became more grievous. So the king determined to divide the\\nnation in half, and to make the two portions draw lots, the one to\\nstay, the other to leave the land. He would continue to reign over\\nthose whose lot it should be to remain behind; the emigrants should\\nhave his son Tyrrhenus for their leader. The lot was cast, and they\\nwho had to emigrate went down to Smyrna, and built themselves ships,\\nin which, after they had put on board all needful stores, they sailed\\naway in search of new homes and better sustenance. After sailing past\\nmany countries they came to Umbria, where they built cities for themselves,\\nand fixed their residence. Their former name of Lydians they laid\\naside, and called themselves after the name of the king\\'s son, who\\nled the colony, Tyrrhenians. \\n\\nThus far I have been engaged in showing how the Lydians were brought\\nunder the Persian yoke. The course of my history now compels me to\\ninquire who this Cyrus was by whom the Lydian empire was destroyed,\\nand by what means the Persians had become the lords paramount of Asia.\\nAnd herein I shall follow those Persian authorities whose object it\\nappears to be not to magnify the exploits of Cyrus, but to relate\\nthe simple truth. I know besides three ways in which the story of\\nCyrus is told, all differing from my own narrative. \\n\\nThe Assyrians had held the Empire of Upper Asia for the space of five\\nhundred and twenty years, when the Medes set the example of revolt\\nfrom their authority. They took arms for the recovery of their freedom,\\nand fought a battle with the Assyrians, in which they behaved with\\nsuch gallantry as to shake off the yoke of servitude, and to become\\na free people. Upon their success the other nations also revolted\\nand regained their independence. \\n\\nThus the nations over that whole extent of country obtained the blessing\\nof self-government, but they fell again under the sway of kings, in\\nthe manner which I will now relate. There was a certain Mede named\\nDeioces, son of Phraortes, a man of much wisdom, who had conceived\\nthe desire of obtaining to himself the sovereign power. In furtherance\\nof his ambition, therefore, he formed and carried into execution the\\nfollowing scheme. As the Medes at that time dwelt in scattered villages\\nwithout any central authority, and lawlessness in consequence prevailed\\nthroughout the land, Deioces, who was already a man of mark in his\\nown village, applied himself with greater zeal and earnestness than\\never before to the practice of justice among his fellows. It was his\\nconviction that justice and injustice are engaged in perpetual war\\nwith one another. He therefore began his course of conduct, and presently\\nthe men of his village, observing his integrity, chose him to be the\\narbiter of all their disputes. Bent on obtaining the sovereign power,\\nhe showed himself an honest and an upright judge, and by these means\\ngained such credit with his fellow-citizens as to attract the attention\\nof those who lived in the surrounding villages. They had long been\\nsuffering from unjust and oppressive judgments; so that, when they\\nheard of the singular uprightness of Deioces, and of the equity of\\nhis decisions, they joyfully had recourse to him in the various quarrels\\nand suits that arose, until at last they came to put confidence in\\nno one else. \\n\\nThe number of complaints brought before him continually increasing,\\nas people learnt more and more the fairness of his judgments, Deioces,\\nfeeling himself now all important, announced that he did not intend\\nany longer to hear causes, and appeared no more in the seat in which\\nhe had been accustomed to sit and administer justice. \"It did not\\nsquare with his interests,\" he said, \"to spend the whole day in regulating\\nother men\\'s affairs to the neglect of his own.\" Hereupon robbery and\\nlawlessness broke out afresh, and prevailed through the country even\\nmore than heretofore; wherefore the Medes assembled from all quarters,\\nand held a consultation on the state of affairs. The speakers, as\\nI think, were chiefly friends of Deioces. \"We cannot possibly,\" they\\nsaid, \"go on living in this country if things continue as they now\\nare; let us therefore set a king over us, that so the land may be\\nwell governed, and we ourselves may be able to attend to our own affairs,\\nand not be forced to quit our country on account of anarchy.\" The\\nassembly was persuaded by these arguments, and resolved to appoint\\na king. \\n\\nIt followed to determine who should be chosen to the office. When\\nthis debate began the claims of Deioces and his praises were at once\\nin every mouth; so that presently all agreed that he should be king.\\nUpon this he required a palace to be built for him suitable to his\\nrank, and a guard to be given him for his person. The Medes complied,\\nand built him a strong and large palace, on a spot which he himself\\npointed out, and likewise gave him liberty to choose himself a bodyguard\\nfrom the whole nation. Thus settled upon the throne, he further required\\nthem to build a single great city, and, disregarding the petty towns\\nin which they had formerly dwelt, make the new capital the object\\nof their chief attention. The Medes were again obedient, and built\\nthe city now called Agbatana, the walls of which are of great size\\nand strength, rising in circles one within the other. The plan of\\nthe place is that each of the walls should out-top the one beyond\\nit by the battlements. The nature of the ground, which is a gentle\\nhill, favours this arrangement in some degree, but it was mainly effected\\nby art. The number of the circles is seven, the royal palace and the\\ntreasuries standing within the last. The circuit of the outer wall\\nis very nearly the same with that of Athens. Of this wall the battlements\\nare white, of the next black, of the third scarlet, of the fourth\\nblue, of the fifth orange; all these are coloured with paint. The\\ntwo last have their battlements coated respectively with silver and\\ngold. \\n\\nAll these fortifications Deioces caused to be raised for himself and\\nhis own palace. The people were required to build their dwellings\\noutside the circuit of the walls. When the town was finished, he proceeded\\nto arrange the ceremonial. He allowed no one to have direct access\\nto the person of the king, but made all communication pass through\\nthe hands of messengers, and forbade the king to be seen by his subjects.\\nHe also made it an offence for any one whatsoever to laugh or spit\\nin the royal presence. This ceremonial, of which he was the first\\ninventor, Deioces established for his own security, fearing that his\\ncompeers, who were brought up together with him, and were of as good\\nfamily as he, and no whit inferior to him in manly qualities, if they\\nsaw him frequently would be pained at the sight, and would therefore\\nbe likely to conspire against him; whereas if they did not see him,\\nthey would think him quite a different sort of being from themselves.\\n\\nAfter completing these arrangements, and firmly settling himself upon\\nthe throne, Deioces continued to administer justice with the same\\nstrictness as before. Causes were stated in writing, and sent in to\\nthe king, who passed his judgment upon the contents, and transmitted\\nhis decisions to the parties concerned: besides which he had spies\\nand eavesdroppers in all parts of his dominions, and if he heard of\\nany act of oppression, he sent for the guilty party, and awarded him\\nthe punishment meet for his offence. \\n\\nThus Deioces collected the Medes into a nation, and ruled over them\\nalone. Now these are the tribes of which they consist: the Busae,\\nthe Paretaceni, the Struchates, the Arizanti, the Budii, and the Magi.\\n\\nHaving reigned three-and-fifty years, Deioces was at his death succeeded\\nby his son Phraortes. This prince, not satisfied with a dominion which\\ndid not extend beyond the single nation of the Medes, began by attacking\\nthe Persians; and marching an army into their country, brought them\\nunder the Median yoke before any other people. After this success,\\nbeing now at the head of two nations, both of them powerful, he proceeded\\nto conquer Asia, overrunning province after province. At last he engaged\\nin war with the Assyrians- those Assyrians, I mean, to whom Nineveh\\nbelonged, who were formerly the lords of Asia. At present they stood\\nalone by the revolt and desertion of their allies, yet still their\\ninternal condition was as flourishing as ever. Phraortes attacked\\nthem, but perished in the expedition with the greater part of his\\narmy, after having reigned over the Medes two-and-twenty years.\\n\\nOn the death of Phraortes his son Cyaxares ascended the throne. Of\\nhim it is reported that he was still more war-like than any of his\\nancestors, and that he was the first who gave organisation to an Asiatic\\narmy, dividing the troops into companies, and forming distinct bodies\\nof the spearmen, the archers, and the cavalry, who before his time\\nhad been mingled in one mass, and confused together. He it was who\\nfought against the Lydians on the occasion when the day was changed\\nsuddenly into night, and who brought under his dominion the whole\\nof Asia beyond the Halys. This prince, collecting together all the\\nnations which owned his sway, marched against Nineveh, resolved to\\navenge his father, and cherishing a hope that he might succeed in\\ntaking the town. A battle was fought, in which the Assyrians suffered\\na defeat, and Cyaxares had already begun the siege of the place, when\\na numerous horde of Scyths, under their king Madyes, son of Prtotohyes,\\nburst into Asia in pursuit of the Cimmerians whom they had driven\\nout of Europe, and entered the Median territory. \\n\\nThe distance from the Palus Maeotis to the river Phasis and the Colchians\\nis thirty days\\' journey for a lightly-equipped traveller. From Colchis\\nto cross into Media does not take long- there is only a single intervening\\nnation, the Saspirians, passing whom you find yourself in Media. This\\nhowever was not the road followed by the Scythians, who turned out\\nof the straight course, and took the upper route, which is much longer,\\nkeeping the Caucasus upon their right. The Scythians, having thus\\ninvaded Media, were opposed by the Medes, who gave them battle, but,\\nbeing defeated, lost their empire. The Scythians became masters of\\nAsia. \\n\\nAfter this they marched forward with the design of invading Egypt.\\nWhen they had reached Palestine, however, Psammetichus the Egyptian\\nking met them with gifts and prayers, and prevailed on them to advance\\nno further. On their return, passing through Ascalon, a city of Syria,\\nthe greater part of them went their way without doing any damage;\\nbut some few who lagged behind pillaged the temple of Celestial Venus.\\nI have inquired and find that the temple at Ascalon is the most ancient\\nof all the temples to this goddess; for the one in Cyprus, as the\\nCyprians themselves admit, was built in imitation of it; and that\\nin Cythera was erected by the Phoenicians, who belong to this part\\nof Syria. The Scythians who plundered the temple were punished by\\nthe goddess with the female sickness, which still attaches to their\\nposterity. They themselves confess that they are afflicted with the\\ndisease for this reason, and travellers who visit Scythia can see\\nwhat sort of a disease it is. Those who suffer from it are called\\nEnarees. \\n\\nThe dominion of the Scythians over Asia lasted eight-and-twenty years,\\nduring which time their insolence and oppression spread ruin on every\\nside. For besides the regular tribute, they exacted from the several\\nnations additional imposts, which they fixed at pleasure; and further,\\nthey scoured the country and plundered every one of whatever they\\ncould. At length Cyaxares and the Medes invited the greater part of\\nthem to a banquet, and made them drunk with wine, after which they\\nwere all massacred. The Medes then recovered their empire, and had\\nthe same extent of dominion as before. They took Nineveh- I will relate\\nhow in another history- and conquered all Assyria except the district\\nof Babylonia. After this Cyaxares died, having reigned over the Medes,\\nif we include the time of the Scythian rule, forty years.\\n\\nAstyages, the son of Cyaxares, succeeded to the throne. He had a daughter\\nwho was named Mandane concerning whom he had a wonderful dream. He\\ndreamt that from her such a stream of water flowed forth as not only\\nto fill his capital, but to flood the whole of Asia. This vision he\\nlaid before such of the Magi as had the gift of interpreting dreams,\\nwho expounded its meaning to him in full, whereat he was greatly terrified.\\nOn this account, when his daughter was now of ripe age, he would not\\ngive her in marriage to any of the Medes who were of suitable rank,\\nlest the dream should be accomplished; but he married her to a Persian\\nof good family indeed, but of a quiet temper, whom he looked on as\\nmuch inferior to a Mede of even middle condition. \\n\\nThus Cambyses (for so was the Persian called) wedded Mandane, and\\ntook her to his home, after which, in the very first year, Astyages\\nsaw another vision. He fancied that a vine grew from the womb of his\\ndaughter, and overshadowed the whole of Asia. After this dream, which\\nhe submitted also to the interpreters, he sent to Persia and fetched\\naway Mandane, who was now with child, and was not far from her time.\\nOn her arrival he set a watch over her, intending to destroy the child\\nto which she should give birth; for the Magian interpreters had expounded\\nthe vision to foreshow that the offspring of his daughter would reign\\nover Asia in his stead. To guard against this, Astyages, as soon as\\nCyrus was born, sent for Harpagus, a man of his own house and the\\nmost faithful of the Medes, to whom he was wont to entrust all his\\naffairs, and addressed him thus- \"Harpagus, I beseech thee neglect\\nnot the business with which I am about to charge thee; neither betray\\nthou the interests of thy lord for others\\' sake, lest thou bring destruction\\non thine own head at some future time. Take the child born of Mandane\\nmy daughter; carry him with thee to thy home and slay him there. Then\\nbury him as thou wilt.\" \"Oh! king,\" replied the other, \"never in time\\npast did Harpagus disoblige thee in anything, and be sure that through\\nall future time he will be careful in nothing to offend. If therefore\\nit be thy will that this thing be done, it is for me to serve thee\\nwith all diligence.\" \\n\\nWhen Harpagus had thus answered, the child was given into his hands,\\nclothed in the garb of death, and he hastened weeping to his home.\\nThere on his arrival he found his wife, to whom he told all that Astyages\\nhad said. \"What then,\" said she, \"is it now in thy heart to do?\" \"Not\\nwhat Astyages requires,\" he answered; \"no, he may be madder and more\\nfrantic still than he is now, but I will not be the man to work his\\nwill, or lend a helping hand to such a murder as this. Many things\\nforbid my slaying him. In the first place the boy is my own kith and\\nkin; and next Astyages is old, and has no son. If then when he dies\\nthe crown should go to his daughter- that daughter whose child he\\nnow wishes to slay by my hand- what remains for me but danger of the\\nfearfullest kind? For my own safety, indeed, the child must die; but\\nsome one belonging to Astyages must take his life, not I or mine.\"\\n\\nSo saying he sent off a messenger to fetch a certain Mitradates, one\\nof the herdsmen of Astyages, whose pasturages he knew to be the fittest\\nfor his purpose, lying as they did among mountains infested with wild\\nbeasts. This man was married to one of the king\\'s female slaves, whose\\nMedian name was Spaco, which is in Greek Cyno, since in the Median\\ntongue the word \"Spaca\" means a bitch. The mountains, on the skirts\\nof which his cattle grazed, lie to the north of Agbatana, towards\\nthe Euxine. That part of Media which borders on the Saspirians is\\nan elevated tract, very mountainous, and covered with forests, while\\nthe rest of the Median territory is entirely level ground. On the\\narrival of the herdsman, who came at the hasty summons, Harpagus said\\nto him- \"Astyages requires thee to take this child and lay him in\\nthe wildest part of the hills, where he will be sure to die speedily.\\nAnd he bade me tell thee, that if thou dost not kill the boy, but\\nanyhow allowest him to escape, he will put thee to the most painful\\nof deaths. I myself am appointed to see the child exposed.\"\\n\\nThe herdsman on hearing this took the child in his arms, and went\\nback the way he had come till he reached the folds. There, providentially,\\nhis wife, who had been expecting daily to be put to bed, had just,\\nduring the absence of her husband, been delivered of a child. Both\\nthe herdsman and his wife were uneasy on each other\\'s account, the\\nformer fearful because his wife was so near her time, the woman alarmed\\nbecause it was a new thing for her husband to be sent for by Harpagus.\\nWhen therefore he came into the house upon his return, his wife, seeing\\nhim arrive so unexpectedly, was the first to speak, and begged to\\nknow why Harpagus had sent for him in such a hurry. \"Wife,\" said he,\\n\"when I got to the town I saw and heard such things as I would to\\nheaven I had never seen such things as I would to heaven had never\\nhappened to our masters. Every one was weeping in Harpagus\\'s house.\\nIt quite frightened me, but I went in. The moment I stepped inside,\\nwhat should I see but a baby lying on the floor, panting and whimpering,\\nand all covered with gold, and wrapped in clothes of such beautiful\\ncolours. Harpagus saw me, and directly ordered me to take the child\\nmy arms and carry him off, and what was I to do with him, think you?\\nWhy, to lay him in the mountains, where the wild beasts are most plentiful.\\nAnd he told me it was the king himself that ordered it to be done,\\nand he threatened me with such dreadful things if I failed. So I took\\nthe child up in my arms, and carried him along. I thought it might\\nbe the son of one of the household slaves. I did wonder certainly\\nto see the gold and the beautiful baby-clothes, and I could not think\\nwhy there was such a weeping in Harpagus\\'s house. Well, very soon,\\nas I came along, I got at the truth. They sent a servant with me to\\nshow me the way out of the town, and to leave the baby in my hands;\\nand he told me that the child\\'s mother is the king\\'s daughter Mandane,\\nand his father Cambyses, the son of Cyrus; and that the king orders\\nhim to be killed; and look, here the child is.\" \\n\\nWith this the herdsman uncovered the infant, and showed him to his\\nwife, who, when she saw him, and observed how fine a child and how\\nbeautiful he was, burst into tears, and clinging to the knees of her\\nhusband, besought him on no account to expose the babe; to which he\\nanswered, that it was not possible for him to do otherwise, as Harpagus\\nwould be sure to send persons to see and report to him, and he was\\nto suffer a most cruel death if he disobeyed. Failing thus in her\\nfirst attempt to persuade her husband, the woman spoke a second time,\\nsaying, \"If then there is no persuading thee, and a child must needs\\nbe seen exposed upon the mountains, at least do thus. The child of\\nwhich I have just been delivered is stillborn; take it and lay it\\non the hills, and let us bring up as our own the child of the daughter\\nof Astyages. So shalt thou not be charged with unfaithfulness to thy\\nlord, nor shall we have managed badly for ourselves. Our dead babe\\nwill have a royal funeral, and this living child will not be deprived\\nof life.\" \\n\\nIt seemed to the herdsman that this advice was the best under the\\ncircumstances. He therefore followed it without loss of time. The\\nchild which he had intended to put to death he gave over to his wife,\\nand his own dead child he put in the cradle wherein he had carried\\nthe other, clothing it first in all the other\\'s costly attire, and\\ntaking it in his arms he laid it in the wildest place of all the mountain-range.\\nWhen the child had been three days exposed, leaving one of his helpers\\nto watch the body, he started off for the city, and going straight\\nto Harpagus\\'s house, declared himself ready to show the corpse of\\nthe boy. Harpagus sent certain of his bodyguard, on whom he had the\\nfirmest reliance, to view the body for him, and, satisfied with their\\nseeing it, gave orders for the funeral. Thus was the herdsman\\'s child\\nburied, and the other child, who was afterwards known by the name\\nof Cyrus, was taken by the herdsman\\'s wife, and brought up under a\\ndifferent name. \\n\\nWhen the boy was in his tenth year, an accident which I will now relate,\\ncaused it to be discovered who he was. He was at play one day in the\\nvillage where the folds of the cattle were, along with the boys of\\nhis own age, in the street. The other boys who were playing with him\\nchose the cowherd\\'s son, as he was called, to be their king. He then\\nproceeded to order them about some he set to build him houses, others\\nhe made his guards, one of them was to be the king\\'s eye, another\\nhad the office of carrying his messages; all had some task or other.\\nAmong the boys there was one, the son of Artembares, a Mede of distinction,\\nwho refused to do what Cyrus had set him. Cyrus told the other boys\\nto take him into custody, and when his orders were obeyed, he chastised\\nhim most severely with the whip. The son of Artembares, as soon as\\nhe was let go, full of rage at treatment so little befitting his rank,\\nhastened to the city and complained bitterly to his father of what\\nhad been done to him by Cyrus. He did not, of course, say \"Cyrus,\"\\nby which name the boy was not yet known, but called him the son of\\nthe king\\'s cowherd. Artembares, in the heat of his passion, went to\\nAstyages, accompanied by his son, and made complaint of the gross\\ninjury which had been done him. Pointing to the boy\\'s shoulders, he\\nexclaimed, \"Thus, oh! king, has thy slave, the son of a cowherd, heaped\\ninsult upon us.\" \\n\\nAt this sight and these words Astyages, wishing to avenge the son\\nof Artembares for his father\\'s sake, sent for the cowherd and his\\nboy. When they came together into his presence, fixing his eyes on\\nCyrus, Astyages said, \"Hast thou then, the son of so mean a fellow\\nas that, dared to behave thus rudely to the son of yonder noble, one\\nof the first in my court?\" \"My lord,\" replied the boy, \"I only treated\\nhim as he deserved. I was chosen king in play by the boys of our village,\\nbecause they thought me the best for it. He himself was one of the\\nboys who chose me. All the others did according to my orders; but\\nhe refused, and made light of them, until at last he got his due reward.\\nIf for this I deserve to suffer punishment, here I am ready to submit\\nto it.\" \\n\\nWhile the boy was yet speaking Astyages was struck with a suspicion\\nwho he was. He thought he saw something in the character of his face\\nlike his own, and there was a nobleness about the answer he had made;\\nbesides which his age seemed to tally with the time when his grandchild\\nwas exposed. Astonished at all this, Astyages could not speak for\\na while. At last, recovering himself with difficulty, and wishing\\nto be quit of Artembares, that he might examine the herdsman alone,\\nhe said to the former, \"I promise thee, Artembares, so to settle this\\nbusiness that neither thou nor thy son shall have any cause to complain.\"\\nArtembares retired from his presence, and the attendants, at the bidding\\nof the king, led Cyrus into an inner apartment. Astyages then being\\nleft alone with the herdsman, inquired of him where he had got the\\nboy, and who had given him to him; to which he made answer that the\\nlad was his own child, begotten by himself, and that the mother who\\nbore him was still alive with him in his house. Astyages remarked\\nthat he was very ill-advised to bring himself into such great trouble,\\nand at the same time signed to his bodyguard to lay hold of him. Then\\nthe herdsman, as they were dragging him to the rack, began at the\\nbeginning, and told the whole story exactly as it happened, without\\nconcealing anything, ending with entreaties and prayers to the king\\nto grant him forgiveness. \\n\\nAstyages, having got the truth of the matter from the herdsman, was\\nvery little further concerned about him, but with Harpagus he was\\nexceedingly enraged. The guards were bidden to summon him into the\\npresence, and on his appearance Astyages asked him, \"By what death\\nwas it, Harpagus, that thou slewest the child of my daughter whom\\nI gave into thy hands?\" Harpagus, seeing the cowherd in the room,\\ndid not betake himself to lies, lest he should be confuted and proved\\nfalse, but replied as follows:- \"Sire, when thou gavest the child\\ninto my hands I instantly considered with myself how I could contrive\\nto execute thy wishes, and yet, while guiltless of any unfaithfulness\\ntowards thee, avoid imbruing my hands in blood which was in truth\\nthy daughter\\'s and thine own. And this was how I contrived it. I sent\\nfor this cowherd, and gave the child over to him, telling him that\\nby the king\\'s orders it was to be put to death. And in this I told\\nno lie, for thou hadst so commanded. Moreover, when I gave him the\\nchild, I enjoined him to lay it somewhere in the wilds of the mountains,\\nand to stay near and watch till it was dead; and I threatened him\\nwith all manner of punishment if he failed. Afterwards, when he had\\ndone according to all that I commanded him, and the child had died,\\nI sent some of the most trustworthy of my eunuchs, who viewed the\\nbody for me, and then I had the child buried. This, sire, is the simple\\ntruth, and this is the death by which the child died.\" \\n\\nThus Harpagus related the whole story in a plain, straightforward\\nway; upon which Astyages, letting no sign escape him of the anger\\nthat he felt, began by repeating to him all that he had just heard\\nfrom the cowherd, and then concluded with saying, \"So the boy is alive,\\nand it is best as it is. For the child\\'s fate was a great sorrow to\\nme, and the reproaches of my daughter went to my heart. Truly fortune\\nhas played us a good turn in this. Go thou home then, and send thy\\nson to be with the new comer, and to-night, as I mean to sacrifice\\nthank-offerings for the child\\'s safety to the gods to whom such honour\\nis due, I look to have thee a guest at the banquet.\" \\n\\nHarpagus, on hearing this, made obeisance, and went home rejoicing\\nto find that his disobedience had turned out so fortunately, and that,\\ninstead of being punished, he was invited to a banquet given in honour\\nof the happy occasion. The moment he reached home he called for his\\nson, a youth of about thirteen, the only child of his parents, and\\nbade him go to the palace, and do whatever Astyages should direct.\\nThen, in the gladness of his heart, he went to his wife and told her\\nall that had happened. Astyages, meanwhile, took the son of Harpagus,\\nand slew him, after which he cut him in pieces, and roasted some portions\\nbefore the fire, and boiled others; and when all were duly prepared,\\nhe kept them ready for use. The hour for the banquet came, and Harpagus\\nappeared, and with him the other guests, and all sat down to the feast.\\nAstyages and the rest of the guests had joints of meat served up to\\nthem; but on the table of Harpagus, nothing was placed except the\\nflesh of his own son. This was all put before him, except the hands\\nand feet and head, which were laid by themselves in a covered basket.\\nWhen Harpagus seemed to have eaten his fill, Astyages called out to\\nhim to know how he had enjoyed the repast. On his reply that he had\\nenjoyed it excessively, they whose business it was brought him the\\nbasket, in which were the hands and feet and head of his son, and\\nbade him open it, and take out what he pleased. Harpagus accordingly\\nuncovered the basket, and saw within it the remains of his son. The\\nsight, however, did not scare him, or rob him of his self-possession.\\nBeing asked by Astyages if he knew what beast\\'s flesh it was that\\nhe had been eating, he answered that he knew very well, and that whatever\\nthe king did was agreeable. After this reply, he took with him such\\nmorsels of the flesh as were uneaten, and went home, intending, as\\nI conceive, to collect the remains and bury them. \\n\\nSuch was the mode in which Astyages punished Harpagus: afterwards,\\nproceeding to consider what he should do with Cyrus, his grandchild,\\nhe sent for the Magi, who formerly interpreted his dream in the way\\nwhich alarmed him so much, and asked them how they had expounded it.\\nThey answered, without varying from what they had said before, that\\n\"the boy must needs be a king if he grew up, and did not die too soon.\"\\nThen Astyages addressed them thus: \"The boy has escaped, and lives;\\nhe has been brought up in the country, and the lads of the village\\nwhere he lives have made him their king. All that kings commonly do\\nhe has done. He has had his guards, and his doorkeepers, and his messengers,\\nand all the other usual officers. Tell me, then, to what, think you,\\ndoes all this tend?\" The Magi answered, \"If the boy survives, and\\nhas ruled as a king without any craft or contrivance, in that case\\nwe bid thee cheer up, and feel no more alarm on his account. He will\\nnot reign a second time. For we have found even oracles sometimes\\nfulfilled in an unimportant way; and dreams, still oftener, have wondrously\\nmean accomplishments.\" \"It is what I myself most incline to think,\"\\nAstyages rejoined; \"the boy having been already king, the dream is\\nout, and I have nothing more to fear from him. Nevertheless, take\\ngood heed and counsel me the best you can for the safety of my house\\nand your own interests.\" \"Truly,\" said the Magi in reply, \"it very\\nmuch concerns our interests that thy kingdom be firmly established;\\nfor if it went to this boy it would pass into foreign hands, since\\nhe is a Persian: and then we Medes should lose our freedom, and be\\nquite despised by the Persians, as being foreigners. But so long as\\nthou, our fellow-countryman, art on the throne, all manner of honours\\nare ours, and we are even not without some share in the government.\\nMuch reason therefore have we to forecast well for thee and for thy\\nsovereignty. If then we saw any cause for present fear, be sure we\\nwould not keep it back from thee. But truly we are persuaded that\\nthe dream has had its accomplishment in this harmless way; and so\\nour own fears being at rest, we recommend thee to banish thine. As\\nfor the boy, our advice is that thou send him away to Persia, to his\\nfather and mother.\" \\n\\nAstyages heard their answer with pleasure, and calling Cyrus into\\nhis presence, said to him, \"My child, I was led to do thee a wrong\\nby a dream which has come to nothing: from that wrong thou wert saved\\nby thy own good fortune. Go now with a light heart to Persia; I will\\nprovide thy escort. Go, and when thou gettest to thy journey\\'s end,\\nthou wilt behold thy father and thy mother, quite other people from\\nMitradates the cowherd and his wife.\" \\n\\nWith these words Astyages dismissed his grandchild. On his arrival\\nat the house of Cambyses, he was received by his parents, who, when\\nthey learnt who he was, embraced him heartily, having always been\\nconvinced that he died almost as soon as he was born. So they asked\\nhim by what means he had chanced to escape; and he told them how that\\ntill lately he had known nothing at all about the matter, but had\\nbeen mistaken- oh! so widely!- and how that he had learnt his history\\nby the way, as he came from Media. He had been quite sure that he\\nwas the son of the king\\'s cowherd, but on the road the king\\'s escort\\nhad told him all the truth; and then he spoke of the cowherd\\'s wife\\nwho had brought him up, and filled his whole talk with her praises;\\nin all that he had to tell them about himself, it was always Cyno-\\nCyno was everything. So it happened that his parents, catching the\\nname at his mouth, and wishing to persuade the Persians that there\\nwas a special providence in his preservation, spread the report that\\nCyrus, when he was exposed, was suckled by a bitch. This was the sole\\norigin of the rumour. \\n\\nAfterwards, when Cyrus grew to manhood, and became known as the bravest\\nand most popular of all his compeers, Harpagus, who was bent on revenging\\nhimself upon Astyages, began to pay him court by gifts and messages.\\nHis own rank was too humble for him to hope to obtain vengeance without\\nsome foreign help. When therefore he saw Cyrus, whose wrongs were\\nso similar to his own, growing up expressly (as it were) to be the\\navenger whom he needed, he set to work to procure his support and\\naid in the matter. He had already paved the way for his designs, by\\npersuading, severally, the great Median nobles, whom the harsh rule\\nof their monarch had offended, that the best plan would be to put\\nCyrus at their head, and dethrone Astyages. These preparations made,\\nHarpagus, being now ready for revolt, was anxious to make known his\\nwishes to Cyrus, who still lived in Persia; but as the roads between\\nMedia and Persia were guarded, he had to contrive a means of sending\\nword secretly, which he did in the following way. He took a hare,\\nand cutting open its belly without hurting the fur, he slipped in\\na letter containing what he wanted to say, and then carefully sewing\\nup the paunch, he gave the hare to one of his most faithful slaves,\\ndisguising him as a hunter with nets, and sent him off to Persia to\\ntake the game as a present to Cyrus, bidding him tell Cyrus, by word\\nof mouth, to paunch the animal himself, and let no one be present\\nat the time. \\n\\nAll was done as he wished, and Cyrus, on cutting the hare open, found\\nthe letter inside, and read as follows:- \"Son of Cambyses, the gods\\nassuredly watch over thee, or never wouldst thou have passed through\\nthy many wonderful adventures- now is the time when thou mayst avenge\\nthyself upon Astyages, thy murderer. He willed thy death, remember;\\nto the gods and to me thou owest that thou art still alive. I think\\nthou art not ignorant of what he did to thee, nor of what I suffered\\nat his hands because I committed thee to the cowherd, and did not\\nput thee to death. Listen now to me, and obey my words, and all the\\nempire of Astyages shall be thine. Raise the standard of revolt in\\nPersia, and then march straight on Media. Whether Astyages appoint\\nme to command his forces against thee, or whether he appoint any other\\nof the princes of the Medes, all will go as thou couldst wish. They\\nwill be the first to fall away from him, and joining thy side, exert\\nthemselves to overturn his power. Be sure that on our part all is\\nready; wherefore do thou thy part, and that speedily.\" \\n\\nCyrus, on receiving the tidings contained in this letter, set himself\\nto consider how he might best persuade the Persians to revolt. After\\nmuch thought, he hit on the following as the most expedient course:\\nhe wrote what he thought proper upon a roll, and then calling an assembly\\nof the Persians, he unfolded the roll, and read out of it that Astyages\\nappointed him their general. \"And now,\" said he, \"since it is so,\\nI command you to go and bring each man his reaping-hook.\" With these\\nwords he dismissed the assembly. \\n\\nNow the Persian nation is made up of many tribes. Those which Cyrus\\nassembled and persuaded to revolt from the Medes were the principal\\nones on which all the others are dependent. These are the Pasargadae,\\nthe Maraphians, and the Maspians, of whom the Pasargadae are the noblest.\\nThe Achaemenidae, from which spring all the Perseid kings, is one\\nof their clans. The rest of the Persian tribes are the following:\\nthe Panthialaeans, the Derusiaeans, the Germanians, who are engaged\\nin husbandry; the Daans, the Mardians, the Dropicans, and the Sagartians,\\nwho are nomads. \\n\\nWhen, in obedience to the orders which they had received, the Persians\\ncame with their reaping-hooks, Cyrus led them to a tract of ground,\\nabout eighteen or twenty furlongs each way, covered with thorns, and\\nordered them to clear it before the day was out. They accomplished\\ntheir task; upon which he issued a second order to them, to take the\\nbath the day following, and again come to him. Meanwhile he collected\\ntogether all his father\\'s flocks, both sheep and goats, and all his\\noxen, and slaughtered them, and made ready to give an entertainment\\nto the entire Persian army. Wine, too, and bread of the choicest kinds\\nwere prepared for the occasion. When the morrow came, and the Persians\\nappeared, he bade them recline upon the grass, and enjoy themselves.\\nAfter the feast was over, he requested them to tell him \"which they\\nliked best, to-day\\'s work, or yesterday\\'s?\" They answered that \"the\\ncontrast was indeed strong: yesterday brought them nothing but what\\nwas bad, to-day everything that was good.\" Cyrus instantly seized\\non their reply, and laid bare his purpose in these words: \"Ye men\\nof Persia, thus do matters stand with you. If you choose to hearken\\nto my words, you may enjoy these and ten thousand similar delights,\\nand never condescend to any slavish toil; but if you will not hearken,\\nprepare yourselves for unnumbered toils as hard as yesterday\\'s. Now\\ntherefore follow my bidding, and be free. For myself I feel that I\\nam destined by Providence to undertake your liberation; and you, I\\nam sure, are no whit inferior to the Medes in anything, least of all\\nin bravery. Revolt, therefore, from Astyages, without a moment\\'s delay.\"\\n\\nThe Persians, who had long been impatient of the Median dominion,\\nnow that they had found a leader, were delighted to shake off the\\nyoke. Meanwhile Astyages, informed of the doings of Cyrus, sent a\\nmessenger to summon him to his presence. Cyrus replied, \"Tell Astyages\\nthat I shall appear in his presence sooner than he will like.\" Astyages,\\nwhen he received this message, instantly armed all his subjects, and,\\nas if God had deprived him of his senses, appointed Harpagus to be\\ntheir general, forgetting how greatly he had injured him. So when\\nthe two armies met and engaged, only a few of the Medes, who were\\nnot in the secret, fought; others deserted openly to the Persians;\\nwhile the greater number counterfeited fear, and fled. \\n\\nAstyages, on learning the shameful flight and dispersion of his army,\\nbroke out into threats against Cyrus, saying, \"Cyrus shall nevertheless\\nhave no reason to rejoice\"; and directly he seized the Magian interpreters,\\nwho had persuaded him to allow Cyrus to escape, and impaled them;\\nafter which, he armed all the Medes who had remained in the city,\\nboth young and old; and leading them against the Persians, fought\\na battle, in which he was utterly defeated, his army being destroyed,\\nand he himself falling into the enemy\\'s hands. \\n\\nHarpagus then, seeing him a prisoner, came near, and exulted over\\nhim with many jibes and jeers. Among other cutting speeches which\\nhe made, he alluded to the supper where the flesh of his son was given\\nhim to eat, and asked Astyages to answer him now, how he enjoyed being\\na slave instead of a king? Astyages looked in his face, and asked\\nhim in return, why he claimed as his own the achievements of Cyrus?\\n\"Because,\" said Harpagus, \"it was my letter which made him revolt,\\nand so I am entitled to all the credit of the enterprise.\" Then Astyages\\ndeclared that \"in that case he was at once the silliest and the most\\nunjust of men: the silliest, if when it was in his power to put the\\ncrown on his own head, as it must assuredly have been, if the revolt\\nwas entirely his doing, he had placed it on the head of another; the\\nmost unjust, if on account of that supper he had brought slavery on\\nthe Medes. For, supposing that he was obliged to invest another with\\nthe kingly power, and not retain it himself, yet justice required\\nthat a Mede, rather than a Persian, should receive the dignity. Now,\\nhowever, the Medes, who had been no parties to the wrong of which\\nhe complained, were made slaves instead of lords, and slaves moreover\\nof those who till recently had been their subjects.\" \\n\\nThus after a reign of thirty-five years, Astyages lost his crown,\\nand the Medes, in consequence of his cruelty, were brought under the\\nrule of the Persians. Their empire over the parts of Asia beyond the\\nHalys had lasted one hundred and twenty-eight years, except during\\nthe time when the Scythians had the dominion. Afterwards the Medes\\nrepented of their submission, and revolted from Darius, but were defeated\\nin battle, and again reduced to subjection. Now, however, in the time\\nof Astyages, it was the Persians who under Cyrus revolted from the\\nMedes, and became thenceforth the rulers of Asia. Cyrus kept Astyages\\nat his court during the remainder of his life, without doing him any\\nfurther injury. Such then were the circumstances of the birth and\\nbringing up of Cyrus, and such were the steps by which he mounted\\nthe throne. It was at a later date that he was attacked by Croesus,\\nand overthrew him, as I have related in an earlier portion of this\\nhistory. The overthrow of Croesus made him master of the whole of\\nAsia. \\n\\nThe customs which I know the Persians to observe are the following:\\nthey have no images of the gods, no temples nor altars, and consider\\nthe use of them a sign of folly. This comes, I think, from their not\\nbelieving the gods to have the same nature with men, as the Greeks\\nimagine. Their wont, however, is to ascend the summits of the loftiest\\nmountains, and there to offer sacrifice to Jupiter, which is the name\\nthey give to the whole circuit of the firmament. They likewise offer\\nto the sun and moon, to the earth, to fire, to water, and to the winds.\\nThese are the only gods whose worship has come down to them from ancient\\ntimes. At a later period they began the worship of Urania, which they\\nborrowed from the Arabians and Assyrians. Mylitta is the name by which\\nthe Assyrians know this goddess, whom the Arabians call Alitta, and\\nthe Persians Mitra. \\n\\nTo these gods the Persians offer sacrifice in the following manner:\\nthey raise no altar, light no fire, pour no libations; there is no\\nsound of the flute, no putting on of chaplets, no consecrated barley-cake;\\nbut the man who wishes to sacrifice brings his victim to a spot of\\nground which is pure from pollution, and there calls upon the name\\nof the god to whom he intends to offer. It is usual to have the turban\\nencircled with a wreath, most commonly of myrtle. The sacrificer is\\nnot allowed to pray for blessings on himself alone, but he prays for\\nthe welfare of the king, and of the whole Persian people, among whom\\nhe is of necessity included. He cuts the victim in pieces, and having\\nboiled the flesh, he lays it out upon the tenderest herbage that he\\ncan find, trefoil especially. When all is ready, one of the Magi comes\\nforward and chants a hymn, which they say recounts the origin of the\\ngods. It is not lawful to offer sacrifice unless there is a Magus\\npresent. After waiting a short time the sacrificer carries the flesh\\nof the victim away with him, and makes whatever use of it he may please.\\n\\nOf all the days in the year, the one which they celebrate most is\\ntheir birthday. It is customary to have the board furnished on that\\nday with an ampler supply than common. The richer Persians cause an\\nox, a horse, a camel, and an ass to be baked whole and so served up\\nto them: the poorer classes use instead the smaller kinds of cattle.\\nThey eat little solid food but abundance of dessert, which is set\\non table a few dishes at a time; this it is which makes them say that\\n\"the Greeks, when they eat, leave off hungry, having nothing worth\\nmention served up to them after the meats; whereas, if they had more\\nput before them, they would not stop eating.\" They are very fond of\\nwine, and drink it in large quantities. To vomit or obey natural calls\\nin the presence of another is forbidden among them. Such are their\\ncustoms in these matters. \\n\\nIt is also their general practice to deliberate upon affairs of weight\\nwhen they are drunk; and then on the morrow, when they are sober,\\nthe decision to which they came the night before is put before them\\nby the master of the house in which it was made; and if it is then\\napproved of, they act on it; if not, they set it aside. Sometimes,\\nhowever, they are sober at their first deliberation, but in this case\\nthey always reconsider the matter under the influence of wine.\\n\\nWhen they meet each other in the streets, you may know if the persons\\nmeeting are of equal rank by the following token: if they are, instead\\nof speaking, they kiss each other on the lips. In the case where one\\nis a little inferior to the other, the kiss is given on the cheek;\\nwhere the difference of rank is great, the inferior prostrates himself\\nupon the ground. Of nations, they honour most their nearest neighbours,\\nwhom they esteem next to themselves; those who live beyond these they\\nhonour in the second degree; and so with the remainder, the further\\nthey are removed, the less the esteem in which they hold them. The\\nreason is that they look upon themselves as very greatly superior\\nin all respects to the rest of mankind, regarding others as approaching\\nto excellence in proportion as they dwell nearer to them; whence it\\ncomes to pass that those who are the farthest off must be the most\\ndegraded of mankind. Under the dominion of the Medes, the several\\nnations of the empire exercised authority over each other in this\\norder. The Medes were lords over all, and governed the nations upon\\ntheir borders, who in their turn governed the States beyond, who likewise\\nbore rule over the nations which adjoined on them. And this is the\\norder which the Persians also follow in their distribution of honour;\\nfor that people, like the Medes, has a progressive scale of administration\\nand government. \\n\\nThere is no nation which so readily adopts foreign customs as the\\nPersians. Thus, they have taken the dress of the Medes, considering\\nit superior to their own; and in war they wear the Egyptian breastplate.\\nAs soon as they hear of any luxury, they instantly make it their own:\\nand hence, among other novelties, they have learnt unnatural lust\\nfrom the Greeks. Each of them has several wives, and a still larger\\nnumber of concubines. \\n\\nNext to prowess in arms, it is regarded as the greatest proof of manly\\nexcellence to be the father of many sons. Every year the king sends\\nrich gifts to the man who can show the largest number: for they hold\\nthat number is strength. Their sons are carefully instructed from\\ntheir fifth to their twentieth year, in three things alone,- to ride,\\nto draw the bow, and to speak the truth. Until their fifth year they\\nare not allowed to come into the sight of their father, but pass their\\nlives with the women. This is done that, if the child die young, the\\nfather may not be afflicted by its loss. \\n\\nTo my mind it is a wise rule, as also is the following- that the king\\nshall not put any one to death for a single fault, and that none of\\nthe Persians shall visit a single fault in a slave with any extreme\\npenalty; but in every case the services of the offender shall be set\\nagainst his misdoings; and, if the latter be found to outweigh the\\nformer, the aggrieved party shall then proceed to punishment.\\n\\nThe Persians maintain that never yet did any one kill his own father\\nor mother; but in all such cases they are quite sure that, if matters\\nwere sifted to the bottom, it would be found that the child was either\\na changeling or else the fruit of adultery; for it is not likely,\\nthey say, that the real father should perish by the hands of his child.\\n\\nThey hold it unlawful to talk of anything which it is unlawful to\\ndo. The most disgraceful thing in the world, they think, is to tell\\na lie; the next worst, to owe a debt: because, among other reasons,\\nthe debtor is obliged to tell lies. If a Persian has the leprosy he\\nis not allowed to enter into a city, or to have any dealings with\\nthe other Persians; he must, they say, have sinned against the sun.\\nForeigners attacked by this disorder, are forced to leave the country:\\neven white pigeons are often driven away, as guilty of the same offence.\\nThey never defile a river with the secretions of their bodies, nor\\neven wash their hands in one; nor will they allow others to do so,\\nas they have a great reverence for rivers. There is another peculiarity,\\nwhich the Persians themselves have never noticed, but which has not\\nescaped my observation. Their names, which are expressive of some\\nbodily or mental excellence, all end with the same letter- the letter\\nwhich is called San by the Dorians, and Sigma by the Ionians. Any\\none who examines will find that the Persian names, one and all without\\nexception, end with this letter. \\n\\nThus much I can declare of the Persians with entire certainty, from\\nmy own actual knowledge. There is another custom which is spoken of\\nwith reserve, and not openly, concerning their dead. It is said that\\nthe body of a male Persian is never buried, until it has been torn\\neither by a dog or a bird of prey. That the Magi have this custom\\nis beyond a doubt, for they practise it without any concealment. The\\ndead bodies are covered with wax, and then buried in the ground.\\n\\nThe Magi are a very peculiar race, different entirely from the Egyptian\\npriests, and indeed from all other men whatsoever. The Egyptian priests\\nmake it a point of religion not to kill any live animals except those\\nwhich they offer in sacrifice. The Magi, on the contrary, kill animals\\nof all kinds with their own hands, excepting dogs and men. They even\\nseem to take a delight in the employment, and kill, as readily as\\nthey do other animals, ants and snakes, and such like flying or creeping\\nthings. However, since this has always been their custom, let them\\nkeep to it. I return to my former narrative. \\n\\nImmediately after the conquest of Lydia by the Persians, the Ionian\\nand Aeolian Greeks sent ambassadors to Cyrus at Sardis, and prayed\\nto become his lieges on the footing which they had occupied under\\nCroesus. Cyrus listened attentively to their proposals, and answered\\nthem by a fable. \"There was a certain piper,\" he said, \"who was walking\\none day by the seaside, when he espied some fish; so he began to pipe\\nto them, imagining they would come out to him upon the land. But as\\nhe found at last that his hope was vain, he took a net, and enclosing\\na great draught of fishes, drew them ashore. The fish then began to\\nleap and dance; but the piper said, \\'Cease your dancing now, as you\\ndid not choose to come and dance when I piped to you.\\'\" Cyrus gave\\nthis answer to the Ionians and Aeolians, because, when he urged them\\nby his messengers to revolt from Croesus, they refused; but now, when\\nhis work was done, they came to offer their allegiance. It was in\\nanger, therefore, that he made them this reply. The Ionians, on hearing\\nit, set to work to fortify their towns, and held meetings at the Panionium,\\nwhich were attended by all excepting the Milesians, with whom Cyrus\\nhad concluded a separate treaty, by which he allowed them the terms\\nthey had formerly obtained from Croesus. The other Ionians resolved,\\nwith one accord, to send ambassadors to Sparta to implore assistance.\\n\\nNow the Ionians of Asia, who meet at the Panionium, have built their\\ncities in a region where the air and climate are the most beautiful\\nin the whole world: for no other region is equally blessed with Ionia,\\nneither above it nor below it, nor east nor west of it. For in other\\ncountries either the climate is over cold and damp, or else the heat\\nand drought are sorely oppressive. The Ionians do not all speak the\\nsame language, but use in different places four different dialects.\\nTowards the south their first city is Miletus, next to which lie Myus\\nand Priene; all these three are in Caria and have the same dialect.\\nTheir cities in Lydia are the following: Ephesus, Colophon, Lebedus,\\nTeos, Clazomenae, and Phocaea. The inhabitants of these towns have\\nnone of the peculiarities of speech which belong to the three first-named\\ncities, but use a dialect of their own. There remain three other Ionian\\ntowns, two situate in isles, namely, Samos and Chios; and one upon\\nthe mainland, which is Erythrae. Of these Chios and Erythrae have\\nthe same dialect, while Samos possesses a language peculiar to itself.\\nSuch are the four varieties of which I spoke. \\n\\nOf the Ionians at this period, one people, the Milesians, were in\\nno danger of attack, as Cyrus had received them into alliance. The\\nislanders also had as yet nothing to fear, since Phoenicia was still\\nindependent of Persia, and the Persians themselves were not a seafaring\\npeople. The Milesians had separated from the common cause solely on\\naccount of the extreme weakness of the Ionians: for, feeble as the\\npower of the entire Hellenic race was at that time, of all its tribes\\nthe Ionic was by far the feeblest and least esteemed, not possessing\\na single State of any mark excepting Athens. The Athenians and most\\nof the other Ionic States over the world, went so far in their dislike\\nof the name as actually to lay it aside; and even at the present day\\nthe greater number of them seem to me to be ashamed of it. But the\\ntwelve cities in Asia have always gloried in the appellation; they\\ngave the temple which they built for themselves the name of the Panionium,\\nand decreed that it should not be open to any of the other Ionic States;\\nno State, however, except Smyrna, has craved admission to it.\\n\\nIn the same way the Dorians of the region which is now called the\\nPentapolis, but which was formerly known as the Doric Hexapolis, exclude\\nall their Dorian neighbours from their temple, the Triopium: nay,\\nthey have even gone so far as to shut out from it certain of their\\nown body who were guilty of an offence against the customs of the\\nplace. In the games which were anciently celebrated in honour of the\\nTriopian Apollo, the prizes given to the victors were tripods of brass;\\nand the rule was that these tripods should not be carried away from\\nthe temple, but should then and there be dedicated to the god. Now\\na man of Halicarnassus, whose name was Agasicles, being declared victor\\nin the games, in open contempt of the law, took the tripod home to\\nhis own house and there hung it against the wall. As a punishment\\nfor this fault, the five other cities, Lindus, Ialyssus, Cameirus,\\nCos, and Cnidus, deprived the sixth city, Halicarnassus, of the right\\nof entering the temple. \\n\\nThe Ionians founded twelve cities in Asia, and refused to enlarge\\nthe number, on account (as I imagine) of their having been divided\\ninto twelve States when they lived in the Peloponnese; just as the\\nAchaeans, who drove them out, are at the present day. The first city\\nof the Achaeans after Sicyon, is Pellene, next to which are Aegeira,\\nAegae upon the Crathis, a stream which is never dry, and from which\\nthe Italian Crathis received its name,- Bura, Helice- where the Ionians\\ntook refuge on their defeat by the Achaean invaders- Aegium, Rhypes,\\nPatreis, Phareis, Olenus on the Peirus, which is a large river- Dyme\\nand Tritaeeis, all sea-port towns except the last two, which lie up\\nthe country. \\n\\nThese are the twelve divisions of what is now Achaea, and was formerly\\nIonia; and it was owing to their coming from a country so divided\\nthat the Ionians, on reaching Asia, founded their twelve States: for\\nit is the height of folly to maintain that these Ionians are more\\nIonian than the rest, or in any respect better born, since the truth\\nis that no small portion of them were Abantians from Euboea, who are\\nnot even Ionians in name; and, besides, there were mixed up with the\\nemigration Minyae from Orchomenus, Cadmeians, Dryopians, Phocians\\nfrom the several cities of Phocis, Molossians, Arcadian Pelasgi, Dorians\\nfrom Epidaurus, and many other distinct tribes. Even those who came\\nfrom the Prytaneum of Athens, and reckon themselves the purest Ionians\\nof all, brought no wives with them to the new country, but married\\nCarian girls, whose fathers they had slain. Hence these women made\\na law, which they bound themselves by an oath to observe, and which\\nthey handed down to their daughters after them, \"That none should\\never sit at meat with her husband, or call him by his name\"; because\\nthe invaders slew their fathers, their husbands, and their sons, and\\nthen forced them to become their wives. It was at Miletus that these\\nevents took place. \\n\\nThe kings, too, whom they set over them, were either Lycians, of the\\nblood of Glaucus, son of Hippolochus, or Pylian Caucons of the blood\\nof Codrus, son of Melanthus; or else from both those families. But\\nsince these Ionians set more store by the name than any of the others,\\nlet them pass for the pure-bred Ionians; though truly all are Ionians\\nwho have their origin from Athens, and keep the Apaturia. This is\\na festival which all the Ionians celebrate, except the Ephesians and\\nthe Colophonians, whom a certain act of bloodshed excludes from it.\\n\\nThe Panionium is a place in Mycale, facing the north, which was chosen\\nby the common voice of the Ionians and made sacred to Heliconian Neptune.\\nMycale itself is a promontory of the mainland, stretching out westward\\ntowards Samos, in which the Ionians assemble from all their States\\nto keep the feast of the Panionia. The names of festivals, not only\\namong the Ionians but among all the Greeks, end, like the Persian\\nproper names, in one and the same letter. \\n\\nThe above-mentioned, then, are the twelve towns of the Ionians. The\\nAeolic cities are the following:- Cyme, called also Phriconis, Larissa,\\nNeonteichus, Temnus, Cilla, Notium, Aegiroessa, Pitane, Aegaeae, Myrina,\\nand Gryneia. These are the eleven ancient cities of the Aeolians.\\nOriginally, indeed, they had twelve cities upon the mainland, like\\nthe Ionians, but the Ionians deprived them of Smyrna, one of the number.\\nThe soil of Aeolis is better than that of Ionia, but the climate is\\nless agreeable. \\n\\nThe following is the way in which the loss of Smyrna happened. Certain\\nmen of Colophon had been engaged in a sedition there, and being the\\nweaker party, were driven by the others into banishment. The Smyrnaeans\\nreceived the fugitives, who, after a time, watching their opportunity,\\nwhile the inhabitants were celebrating a feast to Bacchus outside\\nthe walls, shut to the gates, and so got possession of the town. The\\nAeolians of the other States came to their aid, and terms were agreed\\non between the parties, the Ionians consenting to give up all the\\nmoveables, and the Aeolians making a surrender of the place. The expelled\\nSmyrnaeans were distributed among the other States of the Aeolians,\\nand were everywhere admitted to citizenship. \\n\\nThese, then, were all the Aeolic cities upon the mainland, with the\\nexception of those about Mount Ida, which made no part of this confederacy.\\nAs for the islands, Lesbos contains five cities. Arisba, the sixth,\\nwas taken by the Methymnaeans, their kinsmen, and the inhabitants\\nreduced to slavery. Tenedos contains one city, and there is another\\nwhich is built on what are called the Hundred Isles. The Aeolians\\nof Lesbos and Tenedos, like the Ionian islanders, had at this time\\nnothing to fear. The other Aeolians decided in their common assembly\\nto follow the Ionians, whatever course they should pursue.\\n\\nWhen the deputies of the Ionians and Aeolians, who had journeyed with\\nall speed to Sparta, reached the city, they chose one of their number,\\nPythermus, a Phocaean, to be their spokesman. In order to draw together\\nas large an audience as possible, he clothed himself in a purple garment,\\nand so attired stood forth to speak. In a long discourse he besought\\nthe Spartans to come to the assistance of his countrymen, but they\\nwere not to be persuaded, and voted against sending any succour. The\\ndeputies accordingly went their way, while the Lacedaemonians, notwithstanding\\nthe refusal which they had given to the prayer of the deputation,\\ndespatched a penteconter to the Asiatic coast with certain Spartans\\non board, for the purpose, as I think, of watching Cyrus and Ionia.\\nThese men, on their arrival at Phocaea, sent to Sardis Lacrines, the\\nmost distinguished of their number, to prohibit Cyrus, in the name\\nof the Lacedaemonians, from offering molestation to any city of Greece,\\nsince they would not allow it. \\n\\nCyrus is said, on hearing the speech of the herald, to have asked\\nsome Greeks who were standing by, \"Who these Lacedaemonians were,\\nand what was their number, that they dared to send him such a notice?\"\\nWhen he had received their reply, he turned to the Spartan herald\\nand said, \"I have never yet been afraid of any men, who have a set\\nplace in the middle of their city, where they come together to cheat\\neach other and forswear themselves. If I live, the Spartans shall\\nhave troubles enough of their own to talk of, without concerning themselves\\nabout the Ionians.\" Cyrus intended these words as a reproach against\\nall the Greeks, because of their having market-places where they buy\\nand sell, which is a custom unknown to the Persians, who never make\\npurchases in open marts, and indeed have not in their whole country\\na single market-place. \\n\\nAfter this interview Cyrus quitted Sardis, leaving the city under\\nthe charge of Tabalus, a Persian, but appointing Pactyas, a native,\\nto collect the treasure belonging to Croesus and the other Lydians,\\nand bring after him. Cyrus himself proceeded towards Agbatana, carrying\\nCroesus along with him, not regarding the Ionians as important enough\\nto be his immediate object. Larger designs were in his mind. He wished\\nto war in person against Babylon, the Bactrians, the Sacae, and Egypt;\\nhe therefore determined to assign to one of his generals the task\\nof conquering the Ionians. \\n\\nNo sooner, however, was Cyrus gone from Sardis than Pactyas induced\\nhis countrymen to rise in open revolt against him and his deputy Tabalus.\\nWith the vast treasures at his disposal he then went down to the sea,\\nand employed them in hiring mercenary troops, while at the same time\\nhe engaged the people of the coast to enrol themselves in his army.\\nHe then marched upon Sardis, where he besieged Tabalus, who shut himself\\nup in the citadel. \\n\\nWhen Cyrus, on his way to Agbatana, received these tidings, he returned\\nto Croesus and said, \"Where will all this end, Croesus, thinkest thou?\\nIt seemeth that these Lydians will not cease to cause trouble both\\nto themselves and others. I doubt me if it were not best to sell them\\nall for slaves. Methinks what I have now done is as if a man were\\nto \\'kill the father and then spare the child.\\' Thou, who wert something\\nmore than a father to thy people, I have seized and carried off, and\\nto that people I have entrusted their city. Can I then feel surprise\\nat their rebellion?\" Thus did Cyrus open to Croesus his thoughts;\\nwhereat the latter, full of alarm lest Cyrus should lay Sardis in\\nruins, replied as follows: \"Oh! my king, thy words are reasonable;\\nbut do not, I beseech thee, give full vent to thy anger, nor doom\\nto destruction an ancient city, guiltless alike of the past and of\\nthe present trouble. I caused the one, and in my own person now pay\\nthe forfeit. Pactyas has caused the other, he to whom thou gavest\\nSardis in charge; let him bear the punishment. Grant, then, forgiveness\\nto the Lydians, and to make sure of their never rebelling against\\nthee, or alarming thee more, send and forbid them to keep any weapons\\nof war, command them to wear tunics under their cloaks, and to put\\nbuskins upon their legs, and make them bring up their sons to cithern-playing,\\nharping, and shop-keeping. So wilt thou soon see them become women\\ninstead of men, and there will be no more fear of their revolting\\nfrom thee.\" \\n\\nCroesus thought the Lydians would even so be better off than if they\\nwere sold for slaves, and therefore gave the above advice to Cyrus,\\nknowing that, unless he brought forward some notable suggestion, he\\nwould not be able to persuade him to alter his mind. He was likewise\\nafraid lest, after escaping the danger which now pressed, the Lydians\\nat some future time might revolt from the Persians and so bring themselves\\nto ruin. The advice pleased Cyrus, who consented to forego his anger\\nand do as Croesus had said. Thereupon he summoned to his presence\\na certain Mede, Mazares by name, and charged him to issue orders to\\nthe Lydians in accordance with the terms of Croesus\\' discourse. Further,\\nhe commanded him to sell for slaves all who had joined the Lydians\\nin their attack upon Sardis, and above aught else to be sure that\\nhe brought Pactyas with him alive on his return. Having given these\\norders Cyrus continued his journey towards the Persian territory.\\n\\nPactyas, when news came of the near approach of the army sent against\\nhim, fled in terror to Cyme. Mazares, therefore, the Median general,\\nwho had marched on Sardis with a detachment of the army of Cyrus,\\nfinding on his arrival that Pactyas and his troops were gone, immediately\\nentered the town. And first of all he forced the Lydians to obey the\\norders of his master, and change (as they did from that time) their\\nentire manner of living. Next, he despatched messengers to Cyme, and\\nrequired to have Pactyas delivered up to him. On this the Cymaeans\\nresolved to send to Branchidae and ask the advice of the god. Branchidae\\nis situated in the territory of Miletus, above the port of Panormus.\\nThere was an oracle there, established in very ancient times, which\\nboth the Ionians and Aeolians were wont often to consult.\\n\\nHither therefore the Cymaeans sent their deputies to make inquiry\\nat the shrine, \"What the gods would like them to do with the Lydian,\\nPactyas?\" The oracle told them, in reply, to give him up to the Persians.\\nWith this answer the messengers returned, and the people of Cymd were\\nready to surrender him accordingly; but as they were preparing to\\ndo so, Aristodicus, son of Heraclides, a citizen of distinction, hindered\\nthem. He declared that he distrusted the response, and believed that\\nthe messengers had reported it falsely; until at last another embassy,\\nof which Aristodicus himself made part, was despatched, to repeat\\nthe former inquiry concerning Pactyas. \\n\\nOn their arrival at the shrine of the god, Aristodicus, speaking on\\nbehalf of the whole body, thus addressed the oracle: \"Oh! king, Pactyas\\nthe Lydian, threatened by the Persians with a violent death, has come\\nto us for sanctuary, and lo, they ask him at our hands, calling upon\\nour nation to deliver him up. Now, though we greatly dread the Persian\\npower, yet have we not been bold to give up our suppliant, till we\\nhave certain knowledge of thy mind, what thou wouldst have us to do.\"\\nThe oracle thus questioned gave the same answer as before, bidding\\nthem surrender Pactyas to the Persians; whereupon Aristodicus, who\\nhad come prepared for such an answer, proceeded to make the circuit\\nof the temple, and to take all the nests of young sparrows and other\\nbirds that he could find about the building. As he was thus employed,\\na voice, it is said, came forth from the inner sanctuary, addressing\\nAristodicus in these words: \"Most impious of men, what is this thou\\nhast the face to do? Dost thou tear my suppliants from my temple?\"\\nAristodicus, at no loss for a reply, rejoined, \"Oh, king, art thou\\nso ready to protect thy suppliants, and dost thou command the Cymaeans\\nto give up a suppliant?\" \"Yes,\" returned the god, \"I do command it,\\nthat so for the impiety you may the sooner perish, and not come here\\nagain to consult my oracle about the surrender of suppliants.\"\\n\\nOn the receipt of this answer the Cymaeans, unwilling to bring the\\nthreatened destruction on themselves by giving up the man, and afraid\\nof having to endure a siege if they continued to harbour him, sent\\nPactyas away to Mytilene. On this Mazares despatched envoys to the\\nMytilenaeans to demand the fugitive of them, and they were preparing\\nto give him up for a reward (I cannot say with certainty how large,\\nas the bargain was not completed), when the Cymaeans hearing what\\nthe Mytilenaeans were about, sent a vessel to Lesbos, and conveyed\\naway Pactyas to Chios. From hence it was that he was surrendered.\\nThe Chians dragged him from the temple of Minerva Poliuchus and gave\\nhim up to the Persians, on condition of receiving the district of\\nAtarneus, a tract of Mysia opposite to Lesbos, as the price of the\\nsurrender. Thus did Pactyas fall into the hands of his pursuers, who\\nkept a strict watch upon him that they might be able to produce him\\nbefore Cyrus. For a long time afterwards none of the Chians would\\nuse the barley of Atarneus to place on the heads of victims, or make\\nsacrificial cakes of the corn grown there, but the whole produce of\\nthe land was excluded from all their temples. \\n\\nMeanwhile Mazares, after he had recovered Pactyas from the Chians,\\nmade war upon those who had taken part in the attack on Tabalus, and\\nin the first place took Priene and sold the inhabitants for slaves,\\nafter which he overran the whole plain of the Maeander and the district\\nof Magnesia, both of which he gave up for pillage to the soldiery.\\nHe then suddenly sickened and died. \\n\\nUpon his death Harpagus was sent down to the coast to succeed to his\\ncommand. He also was of the race of the Medes, being the man whom\\nthe Median king, Astyages, feasted at the unholy banquet, and who\\nlent his aid to Place Cyrus upon the throne. Appointed by Cyrus to\\nconduct the war in these parts, he entered Ionia, and took the cities\\nby means of mounds. Forcing the enemy to shut themselves up within\\ntheir defences, he heaped mounds of earth against their walls, and\\nthus carried the towns. Phocaea was the city against which he directed\\nhis first attack. \\n\\nNow the Phocaeans were the first of the Greeks who performed long\\nvoyages, and it was they who made the Greeks acquainted with the Adriatic\\nand with Tyrrhenia, with Iberia, and the city of Tartessus. The vessel\\nwhich they used in their voyages was not the round-built merchant-ship,\\nbut the long penteconter. On their arrival at Tartessus, the king\\nof the country, whose name was Arganthonius, took a liking to them.\\nThis monarch reigned over the Tartessians for eighty years, and lived\\nto be a hundred and twenty years old. He regarded the Phocaeans with\\nso much favour as, at first, to beg them to quit Ionia and settle\\nin whatever part of his country they liked. Afterwards, finding that\\nhe could not prevail upon them to agree to this, and hearing that\\nthe Mede was growing great in their neighbourhood, he gave them money\\nto build a wall about their town, and certainly he must have given\\nit with a bountiful hand, for the town is many furlongs in circuit,\\nand the wall is built entirely of great blocks of stone skilfully\\nfitted together. The wall, then, was built by his aid. \\n\\nHarpagus, having advanced against the Phocaeans with his army, laid\\nsiege to their city, first, however, offering them terms. \"It would\\ncontent him,\" he said, \"if the Phocaeans would agree to throw down\\none of their battlements, and dedicate one dwelling-house to the king.\"\\nThe Phocaeans, sorely vexed at the thought of becoming slaves, asked\\na single day to deliberate on the answer they should return, and besought\\nHarpagus during that day to draw off his forces from the walls. Harpagus\\nreplied, \"that he understood well enough what they were about to do,\\nbut nevertheless he would grant their request.\" Accordingly the troops\\nwere withdrawn, and the Phocaeans forthwith took advantage of their\\nabsence to launch their penteconters, and put on board their wives\\nand children, their household goods, and even the images of their\\ngods, with all the votive offerings from the fanes except the paintings\\nand the works in stone or brass, which were left behind. With the\\nrest they embarked, and putting to sea, set sail for Chios. The Persians,\\non their return, took possession of an empty town. \\n\\nArrived at Chios, the Phocaeans made offers for the purchase of the\\nislands called the Oenussae, but the Chians refused to part with them,\\nfearing lest the Phocaeans should establish a factory there, and exclude\\ntheir merchants from the commerce of those seas. On their refusal,\\nthe Phocaeans, as Arganthonius was now dead, made up their minds to\\nsail to Cyrnus (Corsica), where, twenty years before, following the\\ndirection of an oracle, they had founded a city, which was called\\nAlalia. Before they set out, however, on this voyage, they sailed\\nonce more to Phocaea, and surprising the Persian troops appointed\\nby Harpagus to garrison town, put them all to the sword. After this\\nlaid the heaviest curses on the man who should draw back and forsake\\nthe armament; and having dropped a heavy mass of iron into the sea,\\nswore never to return to Phocaea till that mass reappeared upon the\\nsurface. Nevertheless, as they were preparing to depart for Cyrnus,\\nmore than half of their number were seized with such sadness and so\\ngreat a longing to see once more their city and their ancient homes,\\nthat they broke the oath by which they had bound themselves and sailed\\nback to Phocaea. \\n\\nThe rest of the Phocaeans who kept their oath, proceeded without stopping\\nupon their voyage, and when they came to Cyrnus established themselves\\nalong with the earlier settlers at Alalia and built temples in the\\nplace. For five years they annoyed their neighbours by plundering\\nand pillaging on all sides, until at length the Carthaginians and\\nTyrrhenians leagued against them, and sent each a fleet of sixty ships\\nto attack the town. The Phocaeans, on their part, manned all their\\nvessels, sixty in number, and met their enemy on the Sardinian sea.\\nIn the engagement which followed the Phocaeans were victorious, but\\ntheir success was only a sort of Cadmeian victory.\\' They lost forty\\nships in the battle, and the twenty which remained came out of the\\nengagement with beaks so bent and blunted as to be no longer serviceable.\\nThe Phocaeans therefore sailed back again to Alalia, and taking their\\nwives and children on board, with such portion of their goods and\\nchattels as the vessels could bear, bade adieu to Cyrnus and sailed\\nto Rhegium. \\n\\nThe Carthaginians and Tyrrhenians, who had got into their hands many\\nmore than the Phocaeans from among the crews of the forty vessels\\nthat were destroyed, landed their captives upon the coast after the\\nfight, and stoned them all to death. Afterwards, when sheep, or oxen,\\nor even men of the district of Agylla passed by the spot where the\\nmurdered Phocaeans lay, their bodies became distorted, or they were\\nseized with palsy, or they lost the use of some of their limbs. On\\nthis the people of Agylla sent to Delphi to ask the oracle how they\\nmight expiate their sin. The answer of the Pythoness required them\\nto institute the custom, which they still observe, of honouring the\\ndead Phocaeans with magnificent funeral rites, and solemn games, both\\ngymnic and equestrian. Such, then, was the fate that befell the Phocaean\\nprisoners. The other Phocaeans, who had fled to Rhegium, became after\\na while the founders of the city called Vela, in the district of Oenotria.\\nThis city they colonised, upon the showing of a man of Posidonia,\\nwho suggested that the oracle had not meant to bid them set up a town\\nin Cyrnus the island, but set up the worship of Cyrnus the hero.\\n\\nThus fared it with the men of the city of Phocaea in Ionia. They of\\nTeos did and suffered almost the same; for they too, when Harpagus\\nhad raised his mound to the height of their defences, took ship, one\\nand all, and sailing across the sea to Thrace, founded there the city\\nof Abdera. The site was one which Timesius of Clazomenae had previously\\ntried to colonise, but without any lasting success, for he was expelled\\nby the Thracians. Still the Teians of Abdera worship him to this day\\nas a hero. \\n\\nOf all the Ionians these two states alone, rather than submit to slavery,\\nforsook their fatherland. The others (I except Miletus) resisted Harpagus\\nno less bravely than those who fled their country, and performed many\\nfeats of arms, each fighting in their own defence, but one after another\\nthey suffered defeat; the cities were taken, and the inhabitants submitted,\\nremaining in their respective countries, and obeying the behests of\\ntheir new lords. Miletus, as I have already mentioned, had made terms\\nwith Cyrus, and so continued at peace. Thus was continental Ionia\\nonce more reduced to servitude; and when the Ionians of the islands\\nsaw their brethren upon the mainland subjugated, they also, dreading\\nthe like, gave themselves up to Cyrus. \\n\\nIt was while the Ionians were in this distress, but still, amid it\\nall, held their meetings, as of old, at the Panionium, that Bias of\\nPriene, who was present at the festival, recommended (as I am informed)\\na project of the very highest wisdom, which would, had it been embraced,\\nhave enabled the Ionians to become the happiest and most flourishing\\nof the Greeks. He exhorted them \"to join in one body, set sail for\\nSardinia, and there found a single Pan-Ionic city; so they would escape\\nfrom slavery and rise to great fortune, being masters of the largest\\nisland in the world, exercising dominion even beyond its bounds; whereas\\nif they stayed in Ionia, he saw no prospect of their ever recovering\\ntheir lost freedom.\" Such was the counsel which Bias gave the Ionians\\nin their affliction. Before their misfortunes began, Thales, a man\\nof Miletus, of Phoenician descent, had recommended a different plan.\\nHe counselled them to establish a single seat of government, and pointed\\nout Teos as the fittest place for it; \"for that,\" he said, \"was the\\ncentre of Ionia. Their other cities might still continue to enjoy\\ntheir own laws, just as if they were independent states.\" This also\\nwas good advice. \\n\\nAfter conquering the Ionians, Harpagus proceeded to attack the Carians,\\nthe Caunians, and the Lycians. The Ionians and Aeolians were forced\\nto serve in his army. Now, of the above nations the Carians are a\\nrace who came into the mainland from the islands. In ancient times\\nthey were subjects of king Minos, and went by the name of Leleges,\\ndwelling among the isles, and, so far as I have been able to push\\nmy inquiries, never liable to give tribute to any man. They served\\non board the ships of king Minos whenever he required; and thus, as\\nhe was a great conqueror and prospered in his wars, the Carians were\\nin his day the most famous by far of all the nations of the earth.\\nThey likewise were the inventors of three things, the use of which\\nwas borrowed from them by the Greeks; they were the first to fasten\\ncrests on helmets and to put devices on shields, and they also invented\\nhandles for shields. In the earlier times shields were without handles,\\nand their wearers managed them by the aid of a leathern thong, by\\nwhich they were slung round the neck and left shoulder. Long after\\nthe time of Minos, the Carians were driven from the islands by the\\nIonians and Dorians, and so settled upon the mainland. The above is\\nthe account which the Cretans give of the Carians: the Carians themselves\\nsay very differently. They maintain that they are the aboriginal inhabitants\\nof the part of the mainland where they now dwell, and never had any\\nother name than that which they still bear; and in proof of this they\\nshow an ancient temple of Carian Jove in the country of the Mylasians,\\nin which the Mysians and Lydians have the right of worshipping, as\\nbrother races to the Carians: for Lydus and Mysus, they say, were\\nbrothers of Car. These nations, therefore, have the aforesaid right;\\nbut such as are of a different race, even though they have come to\\nuse the Carian tongue, are excluded from this temple. \\n\\nThe Caunians, in my judgment, are aboriginals; but by their own account\\nthey came from Crete. In their language, either they have approximated\\nto the Carians, or the Carians to them- on this point I cannot speak\\nwith certainty. In their customs, however, they differ greatly from\\nthe Carians, and not only so, but from all other men. They think it\\na most honourable practice for friends or persons of the same age,\\nwhether they be men, women, or children, to meet together in large\\ncompanies, for the purpose of drinking wine. Again, on one occasion\\nthey determined that they would no longer make use of the foreign\\ntemples which had been long established among them, but would worship\\ntheir own old ancestral gods alone. Then their whole youth took arms,\\nand striking the air with their spears, marched to the Calyndic frontier,\\ndeclaring that they were driving out the foreign gods. \\n\\nThe Lycians are in good truth anciently from Crete; which island,\\nin former days, was wholly peopled with barbarians. A quarrel arising\\nthere between the two sons of Europa, Sarpedon and Minos, as to which\\nof them should be king, Minos, whose party prevailed, drove Sarpedon\\nand his followers into banishment. The exiles sailed to Asia, and\\nlanded on the Milyan territory. Milyas was the ancient name of the\\ncountry now inhabited by the Lycians: the Milyae of the present day\\nwere, in those times, called Solymi. So long as Sarpedon reigned,\\nhis followers kept the name which they brought with them from Crete,\\nand were called Termilae, as the Lycians still are by those who live\\nin their neighbourhood. But after Lycus, the son of Pandion, banished\\nfrom Athens by his brother Aegeus had found a refuge with Sarpedon\\nin the country of these Termilae, they came, in course of time, to\\nbe called from him Lycians. Their customs are partly Cretan, partly\\nCarian. They have, however, one singular custom in which they differ\\nfrom every other nation in the world. They take the mother\\'s and not\\nthe father\\'s name. Ask a Lycian who he is, and he answers by giving\\nhis own name, that of his mother, and so on in the female line. Moreover,\\nif a free woman marry a man who is a slave, their children are full\\ncitizens; but if a free man marry a foreign woman, or live with a\\nconcubine, even though he be the first person in the State, the children\\nforfeit all the rights of citizenship. \\n\\nOf these nations, the Carians submitted to Harpagus without performing\\nany brilliant exploits. Nor did the Greeks who dwelt in Caria behave\\nwith any greater gallantry. Among them were the Cnidians, colonists\\nfrom Lacedaemon, who occupy a district facing the sea, which is called\\nTriopium. This region adjoins upon the Bybassian Chersonese; and,\\nexcept a very small space, is surrounded by the sea, being bounded\\non the north by the Ceramic Gulf, and on the south by the channel\\ntowards the islands of Syme and Rhodes. While Harpagus was engaged\\nin the conquest of Ionia, the Cnidians, wishing to make their country\\nan island, attempted to cut through this narrow neck of land, which\\nwas no more than five furlongs across from sea to sea. Their whole\\nterritory lay inside the isthmus; for where Cnidia ends towards the\\nmainland, the isthmus begins which they were now seeking to cut through.\\nThe work had been commenced, and many hands were employed upon it,\\nwhen it was observed that there seemed to be something unusual and\\nunnatural in the number of wounds that the workmen received, especially\\nabout their eyes, from the splintering of the rock. The Cnidians,\\ntherefore, sent to Delphi, to inquire what it was that hindered their\\nefforts; and received, according to their own account, the following\\nanswer from the oracle:- \\n\\nFence not the isthmus off, nor dig it through- \\nJove would have made an island, had he wished. So the Cnidians ceased\\ndigging, and when Harpagus advanced with his army, they gave themselves\\nup to him without striking a blow. \\n\\nAbove Halicarnassus and further from the coast, were the Pedasians.\\nWith this people, when any evil is about to befall either themselves\\nor their neighbours, the priestess of Minerva grows an ample beard.\\nThree times has this marvel happened. They alone, of all the dwellers\\nin Caria, resisted Harpagus for a while, and gave him much trouble,\\nmaintaining themselves in a certain mountain called Lida, which they\\nhad fortified; but in course of time they also were forced to submit.\\n\\nWhen Harpagus, after these successes, led his forces into the Xanthian\\nplain, the Lycians of Xanthus went out to meet him in the field: though\\nbut a small band against a numerous host, they engaged in battle,\\nand performed many glorious exploits. Overpowered at last, and forced\\nwithin their walls, they collected into the citadel their wives and\\nchildren, all their treasures, and their slaves; and having so done,\\nfired the building, and burnt it to the ground. After this, they bound\\nthemselves together by dreadful oaths, and sallying forth against\\nthe enemy, died sword in hand, not one escaping. Those Lycians who\\nnow claim to be Xanthians, are foreign immigrants, except eighty families,\\nwho happened to be absent from the country, and so survived the others.\\nThus was Xanthus taken by Harpagus, and Caunus fell in like manner\\ninto his hands; for the Caunians in the main followed the example\\nof the Lycians. \\n\\nWhile the lower parts of Asia were in this way brought under by Harpagus,\\nCyrus in person subjected the upper regions, conquering every nation,\\nand not suffering one to escape. Of these conquests I shall pass by\\nthe greater portion, and give an account of those only which gave\\nhim the most trouble, and are the worthiest of mention. When he had\\nbrought all the rest of the continent under his sway, he made war\\non the Assyrians. \\n\\nAssyria possesses a vast number of great cities, whereof the most\\nrenowned and strongest at this time was Babylon, whither, after the\\nfall of Nineveh, the seat of government had been removed. The following\\nis a description of the place:- The city stands on a broad plain,\\nand is an exact square, a hundred and twenty furlongs in length each\\nway, so that the entire circuit is four hundred and eighty furlongs.\\nWhile such is its size, in magnificence there is no other city that\\napproaches to it. It is surrounded, in the first place, by a broad\\nand deep moat, full of water, behind which rises a wall fifty royal\\ncubits in width, and two hundred in height. (The royal cubit is longer\\nby three fingers\\' breadth than the common cubit.) \\n\\nAnd here I may not omit to tell the use to which the mould dug out\\nof the great moat was turned, nor the manner wherein the wall was\\nwrought. As fast as they dug the moat the soil which they got from\\nthe cutting was made into bricks, and when a sufficient number were\\ncompleted they baked the bricks in kilns. Then they set to building,\\nand began with bricking the borders of the moat, after which they\\nproceeded to construct the wall itself, using throughout for their\\ncement hot bitumen, and interposing a layer of wattled reeds at every\\nthirtieth course of the bricks. On the top, along the edges of the\\nwall, they constructed buildings of a single chamber facing one another,\\nleaving between them room for a four-horse chariot to turn. In the\\ncircuit of the wall are a hundred gates, all of brass, with brazen\\nlintels and side-posts. The bitumen used in the work was brought to\\nBabylon from the Is, a small stream which flows into the Euphrates\\nat the point where the city of the same name stands, eight days\\' journey\\nfrom Babylon. Lumps of bitumen are found in great abundance in this\\nriver. \\n\\nThe city is divided into two portions by the river which runs through\\nthe midst of it. This river is the Euphrates, a broad, deep, swift\\nstream, which rises in Armenia, and empties itself into the Erythraean\\nsea. The city wall is brought down on both sides to the edge of the\\nstream: thence, from the corners of the wall, there is carried along\\neach bank of the river a fence of burnt bricks. The houses are mostly\\nthree and four stories high; the streets all run in straight lines,\\nnot only those parallel to the river, but also the cross streets which\\nlead down to the water-side. At the river end of these cross streets\\nare low gates in the fence that skirts the stream, which are, like\\nthe great gates in the outer wall, of brass, and open on the water.\\n\\nThe outer wall is the main defence of the city. There is, however,\\na second inner wall, of less thickness than the first, but very little\\ninferior to it in strength. The centre of each division of the town\\nwas occupied by a fortress. In the one stood the palace of the kings,\\nsurrounded by a wall of great strength and size: in the other was\\nthe sacred precinct of Jupiter Belus, a square enclosure two furlongs\\neach way, with gates of solid brass; which was also remaining in my\\ntime. In the middle of the precinct there was a tower of solid masonry,\\na furlong in length and breadth, upon which was raised a second tower,\\nand on that a third, and so on up to eight. The ascent to the top\\nis on the outside, by a path which winds round all the towers. When\\none is about half-way up, one finds a resting-place and seats, where\\npersons are wont to sit some time on their way to the summit. On the\\ntopmost tower there is a spacious temple, and inside the temple stands\\na couch of unusual size, richly adorned, with a golden table by its\\nside. There is no statue of any kind set up in the place, nor is the\\nchamber occupied of nights by any one but a single native woman, who,\\nas the Chaldaeans, the priests of this god, affirm, is chosen for\\nhimself by the deity out of all the women of the land. \\n\\nThey also declare- but I for my part do not credit it- that the god\\ncomes down in person into this chamber, and sleeps upon the couch.\\nThis is like the story told by the Egyptians of what takes place in\\ntheir city of Thebes, where a woman always passes the night in the\\ntemple of the Theban Jupiter. In each case the woman is said to be\\ndebarred all intercourse with men. It is also like the custom of Patara,\\nin Lycia, where the priestess who delivers the oracles, during the\\ntime that she is so employed- for at Patara there is not always an\\noracle- is shut up in the temple every night. \\n\\nBelow, in the same precinct, there is a second temple, in which is\\na sitting figure of Jupiter, all of gold. Before the figure stands\\na large golden table, and the throne whereon it sits, and the base\\non which the throne is placed, are likewise of gold. The Chaldaeans\\ntold me that all the gold together was eight hundred talents\\' weight.\\nOutside the temple are two altars, one of solid gold, on which it\\nis only lawful to offer sucklings; the other a common altar, but of\\ngreat size, on which the full-grown animals are sacrificed. It is\\nalso on the great altar that the Chaldaeans burn the frankincense,\\nwhich is offered to the amount of a thousand talents\\' weight, every\\nyear, at the festival of the God. In the time of Cyrus there was likewise\\nin this temple a figure of a man, twelve cubits high, entirely of\\nsolid gold. I myself did not see this figure, but I relate what the\\nChaldaeans report concerning it. Darius, the son of Hystaspes, plotted\\nto carry the statue off, but had not the hardihood to lay his hands\\nupon it. Xerxes, however, the son of Darius, killed the priest who\\nforbade him to move the statue, and took it away. Besides the ornaments\\nwhich I have mentioned, there are a large number of private offerings\\nin this holy precinct. \\n\\nMany sovereigns have ruled over this city of Babylon, and lent their\\naid to the building of its walls and the adornment of its temples,\\nof whom I shall make mention in my Assyrian history. Among them two\\nwere women. Of these, the earlier, called Semiramis, held the throne\\nfive generations before the later princess. She raised certain embankments\\nwell worthy of inspection, in the plain near Babylon, to control the\\nriver, which, till then, used to overflow, and flood the whole country\\nround about. \\n\\nThe later of the two queens, whose name was Nitocris, a wiser princess\\nthan her predecessor, not only left behind her, as memorials of her\\noccupancy of the throne, the works which I shall presently describe,\\nbut also, observing the great power and restless enterprise of the\\nMedes, who had taken so large a number of cities, and among them Nineveh,\\nand expecting to be attacked in her turn, made all possible exertions\\nto increase the defences of her empire. And first, whereas the river\\nEuphrates, which traverses the city, ran formerly with a straight\\ncourse to Babylon, she, by certain excavations which she made at some\\ndistance up the stream, rendered it so winding that it comes three\\nseveral times in sight of the same village, a village in Assyria,\\nwhich is called Ardericea; and to this day, they who would go from\\nour sea to Babylon, on descending to the river touch three times,\\nand on three different days, at this very place. She also made an\\nembankment along each side of the Euphrates, wonderful both for breadth\\nand height, and dug a basin for a lake a great way above Babylon,\\nclose alongside of the stream, which was sunk everywhere to the point\\nwhere they came to water, and was of such breadth that the whole circuit\\nmeasured four hundred and twenty furlongs. The soil dug out of this\\nbasin was made use of in the embankments along the waterside. When\\nthe excavation was finished, she had stones brought, and bordered\\nwith them the entire margin of the reservoir. These two things were\\ndone, the river made to wind, and the lake excavated, that the stream\\nmight be slacker by reason of the number of curves, and the voyage\\nbe rendered circuitous, and that at the end of the voyage it might\\nbe necessary to skirt the lake and so make a long round. All these\\nworks were on that side of Babylon where the passes lay, and the roads\\ninto Media were the straightest, and the aim of the queen in making\\nthem was to prevent the Medes from holding intercourse with the Babylonians,\\nand so to keep them in ignorance of her affairs. \\n\\nWhile the soil from the excavation was being thus used for the defence\\nof the city, Nitocris engaged also in another undertaking, a mere\\nby-work compared with those we have already mentioned. The city, as\\nI said, was divided by the river into two distinct portions. Under\\nthe former kings, if a man wanted to pass from one of these divisions\\nto the other, he had to cross in a boat; which must, it seems to me,\\nhave been very troublesome. Accordingly, while she was digging the\\nlake, Nitocris be. thought herself of turning it to a use which should\\nat once remove this inconvenience, and enable her to leave another\\nmonument of her reign over Babylon. She gave orders for the hewing\\nof immense blocks of stone, and when they were ready and the basin\\nwas excavated, she turned the entire stream of the Euphrates into\\nthe cutting, and thus for a time, while the basin was filling, the\\nnatural channel of the river was left dry. Forthwith she set to work,\\nand in the first place lined the banks of the stream within the city\\nwith quays of burnt brick, and also bricked the landing-places opposite\\nthe river-gates, adopting throughout the same fashion of brickwork\\nwhich had been used in the town wall; after which, with the materials\\nwhich had been prepared, she built, as near the middle of the town\\nas possible, a stone bridge, the blocks whereof were bound together\\nwith iron and lead. In the daytime square wooden platforms were laid\\nalong from pier to pier, on which the inhabitants crossed the stream;\\nbut at night they were withdrawn, to prevent people passing from side\\nto side in the dark to commit robberies. When the river had filled\\nthe cutting, and the bridge was finished, the Euphrates was turned\\nback again into its ancient bed; and thus the basin, transformed suddenly\\ninto a lake, was seen to answer the purpose for which it was made,\\nand the inhabitants, by help of the basin, obtained the advantage\\nof a bridge. \\n\\nIt was this same princess by whom a remarkable deception was planned.\\nShe had her tomb constructed in the upper part of one of the principal\\ngateways of the city, high above the heads of the passers by, with\\nthis inscription cut upon it:- \"If there be one among my successors\\non the throne of Babylon who is in want of treasure, let him open\\nmy tomb, and take as much as he chooses- not, however, unless he be\\ntruly in want, for it will not be for his good.\" This tomb continued\\nuntouched until Darius came to the kingdom. To him it seemed a monstrous\\nthing that he should be unable to use one of the gates of the town,\\nand that a sum of money should be lying idle, and moreover inviting\\nhis grasp, and he not seize upon it. Now he could not use the gate,\\nbecause, as he drove through, the dead body would have been over his\\nhead. Accordingly he opened the tomb; but instead of money, found\\nonly the dead body, and a writing which said- \"Hadst thou not been\\ninsatiate of pelf, and careless how thou gottest it, thou wouldst\\nnot have broken open the sepulchres of the dead.\" \\n\\nThe expedition of Cyrus was undertaken against the son of this princess,\\nwho bore the same name as his father Labynetus, and was king of the\\nAssyrians. The Great King, when he goes to the wars, is always supplied\\nwith provisions carefully prepared at home, and with cattle of his\\nown. Water too from the river Choaspes, which flows by Susa, is taken\\nwith him for his drink, as that is the only water which the kings\\nof Persia taste. Wherever he travels, he is attended by a number of\\nfour-wheeled cars drawn by mules, in which the Choaspes water, ready\\nboiled for use, and stored in flagons of silver, is moved with him\\nfrom place to place. \\n\\nCyrus on his way to Babylon came to the banks of the Gyndes, a stream\\nwhich, rising in the Matienian mountains, runs through the country\\nof the Dardanians, and empties itself into the river Tigris. The Tigris,\\nafter receiving the Gyndes, flows on by the city of Opis, and discharges\\nits waters into the Erythraean sea. When Cyrus reached this stream,\\nwhich could only be passed in boats, one of the sacred white horses\\naccompanying his march, full of spirit and high mettle, walked into\\nthe water, and tried to cross by himself; but the current seized him,\\nswept him along with it, and drowned him in its depths. Cyrus, enraged\\nat the insolence of the river, threatened so to break its strength\\nthat in future even women should cross it easily without wetting their\\nknees. Accordingly he put off for a time his attack on Babylon, and,\\ndividing his army into two parts, he marked out by ropes one hundred\\nand eighty trenches on each side of the Gyndes, leading off from it\\nin all directions, and setting his army to dig, some on one side of\\nthe river, some on the other, he accomplished his threat by the aid\\nof so great a number of hands, but not without losing thereby the\\nwhole summer season. \\n\\nHaving, however, thus wreaked his vengeance on the Gyndes, by dispersing\\nit through three hundred and sixty channels, Cyrus, with the first\\napproach of the ensuing spring, marched forward against Babylon. The\\nBabylonians, encamped without their walls, awaited his coming. A battle\\nwas fought at a short distance from the city, in which the Babylonians\\nwere defeated by the Persian king, whereupon they withdrew within\\ntheir defences. Here they shut themselves up, and made light of his\\nsiege, having laid in a store of provisions for many years in preparation\\nagainst this attack; for when they saw Cyrus conquering nation after\\nnation, they were convinced that he would never stop, and that their\\nturn would come at last. \\n\\nCyrus was now reduced to great perplexity, as time went on and he\\nmade no progress against the place. In this distress either some one\\nmade the suggestion to him, or he bethought himself of a plan, which\\nhe proceeded to put in execution. He placed a portion of his army\\nat the point where the river enters the city, and another body at\\nthe back of the place where it issues forth, with orders to march\\ninto the town by the bed of the stream, as soon as the water became\\nshallow enough: he then himself drew off with the unwarlike portion\\nof his host, and made for the place where Nitocris dug the basin for\\nthe river, where he did exactly what she had done formerly: he turned\\nthe Euphrates by a canal into the basin, which was then a marsh, on\\nwhich the river sank to such an extent that the natural bed of the\\nstream became fordable. Hereupon the Persians who had been left for\\nthe purpose at Babylon by the, river-side, entered the stream, which\\nhad now sunk so as to reach about midway up a man\\'s thigh, and thus\\ngot into the town. Had the Babylonians been apprised of what Cyrus\\nwas about, or had they noticed their danger, they would never have\\nallowed the Persians to enter the city, but would have destroyed them\\nutterly; for they would have made fast all the street-gates which\\ngave upon the river, and mounting upon the walls along both sides\\nof the stream, would so have caught the enemy, as it were, in a trap.\\nBut, as it was, the Persians came upon them by surprise and so took\\nthe city. Owing to the vast size of the place, the inhabitants of\\nthe central parts (as the residents at Babylon declare) long after\\nthe outer portions of the town were taken, knew nothing of what had\\nchanced, but as they were engaged in a festival, continued dancing\\nand revelling until they learnt the capture but too certainly. Such,\\nthen, were the circumstances of the first taking of Babylon.\\n\\nAmong many proofs which I shall bring forward of the power and resources\\nof the Babylonians, the following is of special account. The whole\\ncountry under the dominion of the Persians, besides paying a fixed\\ntribute, is parcelled out into divisions, which have to supply food\\nto the Great King and his army during different portions of the year.\\nNow out of the twelve months which go to a year, the district of Babylon\\nfurnishes food during four, the other of Asia during eight; by the\\nwhich it appears that Assyria, in respect of resources, is one-third\\nof the whole of Asia. Of all the Persian governments, or satrapies\\nas they are called by the natives, this is by far the best. When Tritantaechmes,\\nson of Artabazus, held it of the king, it brought him in an artaba\\nof silver every day. The artaba is a Persian measure, and holds three\\nchoenixes more than the medimnus of the Athenians. He also had, belonging\\nto his own private stud, besides war horses, eight hundred stallions\\nand sixteen thousand mares, twenty to each stallion. Besides which\\nhe kept so great a number of Indian hounds, that four large villages\\nof the plain were exempted from all other charges on condition of\\nfinding them in food. \\n\\nBut little rain falls in Assyria, enough, however, to make the corn\\nbegin to sprout, after which the plant is nourished and the ears formed\\nby means of irrigation from the river. For the river does not, as\\nin Egypt, overflow the corn-lands of its own accord, but is spread\\nover them by the hand, or by the help of engines. The whole of Babylonia\\nis, like Egypt, intersected with canals. The largest of them all,\\nwhich runs towards the winter sun, and is impassable except in boats,\\nis carried from the Euphrates into another stream, called the Tigris,\\nthe river upon which the town of Nineveh formerly stood. Of all the\\ncountries that we know there is none which is so fruitful in grain.\\nIt makes no pretension indeed of growing the fig, the olive, the vine,\\nor any other tree of the kind; but in grain it is so fruitful as to\\nyield commonly two-hundred-fold, and when the production is the greatest,\\neven three-hundred-fold. The blade of the wheat-plant and barley-plant\\nis often four fingers in breadth. As for the millet and the sesame,\\nI shall not say to what height they grow, though within my own knowledge;\\nfor I am not ignorant that what I have already written concerning\\nthe fruitfulness of Babylonia must seem incredible to those who have\\nnever visited the country. The only oil they use is made from the\\nsesame-plant. Palm-trees grow in great numbers over the whole of the\\nflat country, mostly of the kind which bears fruit, and this fruit\\nsupplies them with bread, wine, and honey. They are cultivated like\\nthe fig-tree in all respects, among others in this. The natives tie\\nthe fruit of the male-palms, as they are called by the Greeks, to\\nthe branches of the date-bearing palm, to let the gall-fly enter the\\ndates and ripen them, and to prevent the fruit from falling off. The\\nmale-palms, like the wild fig-trees, have usually the gall-fly in\\ntheir fruit. \\n\\nBut that which surprises me most in the land, after the city itself,\\nI will now proceed to mention. The boats which come down the river\\nto Babylon are circular, and made of skins. The frames, which are\\nof willow, are cut in the country of the Armenians above Assyria,\\nand on these, which serve for hulls, a covering of skins is stretched\\noutside, and thus the boats are made, without either stem or stern,\\nquite round like a shield. They are then entirely filled with straw,\\nand their cargo is put on board, after which they are suffered to\\nfloat down the stream. Their chief freight is wine, stored in casks\\nmade of the wood of the palm-tree. They are managed by two men who\\nstand upright in them, each plying an oar, one pulling and the other\\npushing. The boats are of various sizes, some larger, some smaller;\\nthe biggest reach as high as five thousand talents\\' burthen. Each\\nvessel has a live ass on board; those of larger size have more than\\none. When they reach Babylon, the cargo is landed and offered for\\nsale; after which the men break up their boats, sell the straw and\\nthe frames, and loading their asses with the skins, set off on their\\nway back to Armenia. The current is too strong to allow a boat to\\nreturn upstream, for which reason they make their boats of skins rather\\nthan wood. On their return to Armenia they build fresh boats for the\\nnext voyage. \\n\\nThe dress of the Babylonians is a linen tunic reaching to the feet,\\nand above it another tunic made in wool, besides which they have a\\nshort white cloak thrown round them, and shoes of a peculiar fashion,\\nnot unlike those worn by the Boeotians. They have long hair, wear\\nturbans on their heads, and anoint their whole body with perfumes.\\nEvery one carries a seal, and a walking-stick, carved at the top into\\nthe form of an apple, a rose, a lily, an eagle, or something similar;\\nfor it is not their habit to use a stick without an ornament.\\n\\nOf their customs, whereof I shall now proceed to give an account,\\nthe following (which I understand belongs to them in common with the\\nIllyrian tribe of the Eneti) is the wisest in my judgment. Once a\\nyear in each village the maidens of age to marry were collected all\\ntogether into one place; while the men stood round them in a circle.\\nThen a herald called up the damsels one by one, and offered them for\\nsale. He began with the most beautiful. When she was sold for no small\\nsum of money, he offered for sale the one who came next to her in\\nbeauty. All of them were sold to be wives. The richest of the Babylonians\\nwho wished to wed bid against each other for the loveliest maidens,\\nwhile the humbler wife-seekers, who were indifferent about beauty,\\ntook the more homely damsels with marriage-portions. For the custom\\nwas that when the herald had gone through the whole number of the\\nbeautiful damsels, he should then call up the ugliest- a cripple,\\nif there chanced to be one- and offer her to the men, asking who would\\nagree to take her with the smallest marriage-portion. And the man\\nwho offered to take the smallest sum had her assigned to him. The\\nmarriage-portions were furnished by the money paid for the beautiful\\ndamsels, and thus the fairer maidens portioned out the uglier. No\\none was allowed to give his daughter in marriage to the man of his\\nchoice, nor might any one carry away the damsel whom he had purchased\\nwithout finding bail really and truly to make her his wife; if, however,\\nit turned out that they did not agree, the money might be paid back.\\nAll who liked might come even from distant villages and bid for the\\nwomen. This was the best of all their customs, but it has now fallen\\ninto disuse. They have lately hit upon a very different plan to save\\ntheir maidens from violence, and prevent their being torn from them\\nand carried to distant cities, which is to bring up their daughters\\nto be courtesans. This is now done by all the poorer of the common\\npeople, who since the conquest have been maltreated by their lords,\\nand have had ruin brought upon their families. \\n\\nThe following custom seems to me the wisest of their institutions\\nnext to the one lately praised. They have no physicians, but when\\na man is ill, they lay him in the public square, and the passers-by\\ncome up to him, and if they have ever had his disease themselves or\\nhave known any one who has suffered from it, they give him advice,\\nrecommending him to do whatever they found good in their own case,\\nor in the case known to them; and no one is allowed to pass the sick\\nman in silence without asking him what his ailment is. \\n\\nThey bury their dead in honey, and have funeral lamentations like\\nthe Egyptians. When a Babylonian has consorted with his wife, he sits\\ndown before a censer of burning incense, and the woman sits opposite\\nto him. At dawn of day they wash; for till they are washed they will\\nnot touch any of their common vessels. This practice is observed also\\nby the Arabians. \\n\\nThe Babylonians have one most shameful custom. Every woman born in\\nthe country must once in her life go and sit down in the precinct\\nof Venus, and there consort with a stranger. Many of the wealthier\\nsort, who are too proud to mix with the others, drive in covered carriages\\nto the precinct, followed by a goodly train of attendants, and there\\ntake their station. But the larger number seat themselves within the\\nholy enclosure with wreaths of string about their heads- and here\\nthere is always a great crowd, some coming and others going; lines\\nof cord mark out paths in all directions the women, and the strangers\\npass along them to make their choice. A woman who has once taken her\\nseat is not allowed to return home till one of the strangers throws\\na silver coin into her lap, and takes her with him beyond the holy\\nground. When he throws the coin he says these words- \"The goddess\\nMylitta prosper thee.\" (Venus is called Mylitta by the Assyrians.)\\nThe silver coin may be of any size; it cannot be refused, for that\\nis forbidden by the law, since once thrown it is sacred. The woman\\ngoes with the first man who throws her money, and rejects no one.\\nWhen she has gone with him, and so satisfied the goddess, she returns\\nhome, and from that time forth no gift however great will prevail\\nwith her. Such of the women as are tall and beautiful are soon released,\\nbut others who are ugly have to stay a long time before they can fulfil\\nthe law. Some have waited three or four years in the precinct. A custom\\nvery much like this is found also in certain parts of the island of\\nCyprus. \\n\\nSuch are the customs of the Babylonians generally. There are likewise\\nthree tribes among them who eat nothing but fish. These are caught\\nand dried in the sun, after which they are brayed in a mortar, and\\nstrained through a linen sieve. Some prefer to make cakes of this\\nmaterial, while others bake it into a kind of bread. \\n\\nWhen Cyrus had achieved the conquest of the Babylonians, he conceived\\nthe desire of bringing the Massagetae under his dominion. Now the\\nMassagetae are said to be a great and warlike nation, dwelling eastward,\\ntoward the rising of the sun, beyond the river Araxes, and opposite\\nthe Issedonians. By many they are regarded as a Scythian race.\\n\\nAs for the Araxes, it is, according to some accounts, larger, according\\nto others smaller than the Ister (Danube). It has islands in it, many\\nof which are said to be equal in size to Lesbos. The men who inhabit\\nthem feed during the summer on roots of all kinds, which they dig\\nout of the ground, while they store up the fruits, which they gather\\nfrom the trees at the fitting season, to serve them as food in the\\nwinter-time. Besides the trees whose fruit they gather for this purpose,\\nthey have also a tree which bears the strangest produce. When they\\nare met together in companies they throw some of it upon the fire\\nround which they are sitting, and presently, by the mere smell of\\nthe fumes which it gives out in burning, they grow drunk, as the Greeks\\ndo with wine. More of the fruit is then thrown on the fire, and, their\\ndrunkenness increasing, they often jump up and begin to dance and\\nsing. Such is the account which I have heard of this people.\\n\\nThe river Araxes, like the Gyndes, which Cyrus dispersed into three\\nhundred and sixty channels, has its source in the country of the Matienians.\\nIt has forty mouths, whereof all, except one, end in bogs and swamps.\\nThese bogs and swamps are said to be inhabited by a race of men who\\nfeed on raw fish, and clothe themselves with the skins of seals. The\\nother mouth of the river flows with a clear course into the Caspian\\nSea. \\n\\nThe Caspian is a sea by itself, having no connection with any other.\\nThe sea frequented by the Greeks, that beyond the Pillars of Hercules,\\nwhich is called the Atlantic, and also the Erythraean, are all one\\nand the same sea. But the Caspian is a distinct sea, lying by itself,\\nin length fifteen days\\' voyage with a row-boat, in breadth, at the\\nbroadest part, eight days\\' voyage. Along its western shore runs the\\nchain of the Caucasus, the most extensive and loftiest of all mountain-ranges.\\nMany and various are the tribes by which it is inhabited, most of\\nwhom live entirely on the wild fruits of the forest. In these forests\\ncertain trees are said to grow, from the leaves of which, pounded\\nand mixed with water, the inhabitants make a dye, wherewith they paint\\nupon their clothes the figures of animals; and the figures so impressed\\nnever wash out, but last as though they had been inwoven in the cloth\\nfrom the first, and wear as long as the garment. \\n\\nOn the west then, as I have said, the Caspian Sea is bounded by the\\nrange of Caucasus. On the cast it is followed by a vast plain, stretching\\nout interminably before the eye, the greater portion of which is possessed\\nby those Massagetae, against whom Cyrus was now so anxious to make\\nan expedition. Many strong motives weighed with him and urged him\\non- his birth especially, which seemed something more than human,\\nand his good fortune in all his former wars, wherein he had always\\nfound that against what country soever he turned his arms, it was\\nimpossible for that people to escape. \\n\\nAt this time the Massagetae were ruled by a queen, named Tomyris,\\nwho at the death of her husband, the late king, had mounted the throne.\\nTo her Cyrus sent ambassadors, with instructions to court her on his\\npart, pretending that he wished to take her to wife. Tomyris, however,\\naware that it was her kingdom, and not herself, that he courted, forbade\\nthe men to approach. Cyrus, therefore, finding that he did not advance\\nhis designs by this deceit, marched towards the Araxes, and openly\\ndisplaying his hostile intentions; set to work to construct a bridge\\non which his army might cross the river, and began building towers\\nupon the boats which were to be used in the passage. \\n\\nWhile the Persian leader was occupied in these labours, Tomyris sent\\na herald to him, who said, \"King of the Medes, cease to press this\\nenterprise, for thou canst not know if what thou art doing will be\\nof real advantage to thee. Be content to rule in peace thy own kingdom,\\nand bear to see us reign over the countries that are ours to govern.\\nAs, however, I know thou wilt not choose to hearken to this counsel,\\nsince there is nothing thou less desirest than peace and quietness,\\ncome now, if thou art so mightily desirous of meeting the Massagetae\\nin arms, leave thy useless toil of bridge-making; let us retire three\\ndays\\' march from the river bank, and do thou come across with thy\\nsoldiers; or, if thou likest better to give us battle on thy side\\nthe stream, retire thyself an equal distance.\" Cyrus, on this offer,\\ncalled together the chiefs of the Persians, and laid the matter before\\nthem, requesting them to advise him what he should do. All the votes\\nwere in favour of his letting Tomyris cross the stream, and giving\\nbattle on Persian ground. \\n\\nBut Croesus the Lydian, who was present at the meeting of the chiefs,\\ndisapproved of this advice; he therefore rose, and thus delivered\\nhis sentiments in opposition to it: \"Oh! my king! I promised thee\\nlong since, that, as Jove had given me into thy hands, I would, to\\nthe best of my power, avert impending danger from thy house. Alas!\\nmy own sufferings, by their very bitterness, have taught me to be\\nkeen-sighted of dangers. If thou deemest thyself an immortal, and\\nthine army an army of immortals, my counsel will doubtless be thrown\\naway upon thee. But if thou feelest thyself to be a man, and a ruler\\nof men, lay this first to heart, that there is a wheel on which the\\naffairs of men revolve, and that its movement forbids the same man\\nto be always fortunate. Now concerning the matter in hand, my judgment\\nruns counter to the judgment of thy other counsellors. For if thou\\nagreest to give the enemy entrance into thy country, consider what\\nrisk is run! Lose the battle, and therewith thy whole kingdom is lost.\\nFor assuredly, the Massagetae, if they win the fight, will not return\\nto their homes, but will push forward against the states of thy empire.\\nOr if thou gainest the battle, why, then thou gainest far less than\\nif thou wert across the stream, where thou mightest follow up thy\\nvictory. For against thy loss, if they defeat thee on thine own ground,\\nmust be set theirs in like case. Rout their army on the other side\\nof the river, and thou mayest push at once into the heart of their\\ncountry. Moreover, were it not disgrace intolerable for Cyrus the\\nson of Cambyses to retire before and yield ground to a woman? My counsel,\\ntherefore, is that we cross the stream, and pushing forward as far\\nas they shall fall back, then seek to get the better of them by stratagem.\\nI am told they are unacquainted with the good things on which the\\nPersians live, and have never tasted the great delights of life. Let\\nus then prepare a feast for them in our camp; let sheep be slaughtered\\nwithout stint, and the winecups be filled full of noble liquor, and\\nlet all manner of dishes be prepared: then leaving behind us our worst\\ntroops, let us fall back towards the river. Unless I very much mistake,\\nwhen they see the good fare set out, they will forget all else and\\nfall to. Then it will remain for us to do our parts manfully.\"\\n\\nCyrus, when the two plans were thus placed in contrast before him,\\nchanged his mind, and preferring the advice which Croesus had given,\\nreturned for answer to Tomyris that she should retire, and that he\\nwould cross the stream. She therefore retired, as she had engaged;\\nand Cyrus, giving Croesus into the care of his son Cambyses (whom\\nhe had appointed to succeed him on the throne), with strict charge\\nto pay him all respect and treat him well, if the expedition failed\\nof success; and sending them both back to Persia, crossed the river\\nwith his army. \\n\\nThe first night after the passage, as he slept in the enemy\\'s country,\\na vision appeared to him. He seemed to see in his sleep the eldest\\nof the sons of Hystaspes, with wings upon his shoulders, shadowing\\nwith the one wing Asia, and Europe with the other. Now Hystaspes,\\nthe son of Arsames, was of the race of the Achaemenidae, and his eldest\\nson, Darius, was at that time scarce twenty years old; wherefore,\\nnot being of age to go to the wars, he had remained behind in Persia.\\nWhen Cyrus woke from his sleep, and turned the vision over in his\\nmind, it seemed to him no light matter. He therefore sent for Hystaspes,\\nand taking him aside said, \"Hystaspes, thy son is discovered to be\\nplotting against me and my crown. I will tell thee how I know it so\\ncertainly. The gods watch over my safety, and warn me beforehand of\\nevery danger. Now last night, as I lay in my bed, I saw in a vision\\nthe eldest of thy sons with wings upon his shoulders, shadowing with\\nthe one wing Asia, and Europe with the other. From this it is certain,\\nbeyond all possible doubt, that he is engaged in some plot against\\nme. Return thou then at once to Persia, and be sure, when I come back\\nfrom conquering the Massagetae, to have thy son ready to produce before\\nme, that I may examine him.\" \\n\\nThus Cyrus spoke, in the belief that he was plotted against by Darius;\\nbut he missed the true meaning of the dream, which was sent by God\\nto forewarn him, that he was to die then and there, and that his kingdom\\nwas to fall at last to Darius. \\n\\nHystaspes made answer to Cyrus in these words:- \"Heaven forbid, sire,\\nthat there should be a Persian living who would plot against thee!\\nIf such an one there be, may a speedy death overtake him! Thou foundest\\nthe Persians a race of slaves, thou hast made them free men: thou\\nfoundest them subject to others, thou hast made them lords of all.\\nIf a vision has announced that my son is practising against thee,\\nlo, I resign him into thy hands to deal with as thou wilt.\" Hystaspes,\\nwhen he had thus answered, recrossed the Araxes and hastened back\\nto Persia, to keep a watch on his son Darius. \\n\\nMeanwhile Cyrus, having advanced a day\\'s march from the river, did\\nas Croesus had advised him, and, leaving the worthless portion of\\nhis army in the camp, drew off with his good troops towards the river.\\nSoon afterwards, a detachment of the Massagetae, one-third of their\\nentire army, led by Spargapises, son of the queen Tomyris, coming\\nup, fell upon the body which had been left behind by Cyrus, and on\\ntheir resistance put them to the sword. Then, seeing the banquet prepared,\\nthey sat down and began to feast. When they had eaten and drunk their\\nfill, and were now sunk in sleep, the Persians under Cyrus arrived,\\nslaughtered a great multitude, and made even a larger number prisoners.\\nAmong these last was Spargapises himself. \\n\\nWhen Tomyris heard what had befallen her son and her army, she sent\\na herald to Cyrus, who thus addressed the conqueror:- \"Thou bloodthirsty\\nCyrus, pride not thyself on this poor success: it was the grape-juice-\\nwhich, when ye drink it, makes you so mad, and as ye swallow it down\\nbrings up to your lips such bold and wicked words- it was this poison\\nwherewith thou didst ensnare my child, and so overcamest him, not\\nin fair open fight. Now hearken what I advise, and be sure I advise\\nthee for thy good. Restore my son to me and get thee from the land\\nunharmed, triumphant over a third part of the host of the Massagetae.\\nRefuse, and I swear by the sun, the sovereign lord of the Massagetae,\\nbloodthirsty as thou art, I will give thee thy fill of blood.\"\\n\\nTo the words of this message Cyrus paid no manner of regard. As for\\nSpargapises, the son of the queen, when the wine went off, \\'and he\\nsaw the extent of his calamity, he made request to Cyrus to release\\nhim from his bonds; then, when his prayer was granted, and the fetters\\nwere taken from his limbs, as soon as his hands were free, he destroyed\\nhimself. \\n\\nTomyris, when she found that Cyrus paid no heed to her advice, collected\\nall the forces of her kingdom, and gave him battle. Of all the combats\\nin which the barbarians have engaged among themselves, I reckon this\\nto have been the fiercest. The following, as I understand, was the\\nmanner of it:- First, the two armies stood apart and shot their arrows\\nat each other; then, when their quivers were empty, they closed and\\nfought hand-to-hand with lances and daggers; and thus they continued\\nfighting for a length of time, neither choosing to give ground. At\\nlength the Massagetae prevailed. The greater part of the army of the\\nPersians was destroyed and Cyrus himself fell, after reigning nine\\nand twenty years. Search was made among the slain by order of the\\nqueen for the body of Cyrus, and when it was found she took a skin,\\nand, filling it full of human blood, she dipped the head of Cyrus\\nin the gore, saying, as she thus insulted the corse, \"I live and have\\nconquered thee in fight, and yet by thee am I ruined, for thou tookest\\nmy son with guile; but thus I make good my threat, and give thee thy\\nfill of blood.\" Of the many different accounts which are given of\\nthe death of Cyrus, this which I have followed appears to me most\\nworthy of credit. \\n\\nIn their dress and mode of living the Massagetae resemble the Scythians.\\nThey fight both on horseback and on foot, neither method is strange\\nto them: they use bows and lances, but their favourite weapon is the\\nbattle-axe. Their arms are all either of gold or brass. For their\\nspear-points, and arrow-heads, and for their battle-axes, they make\\nuse of brass; for head-gear, belts, and girdles, of gold. So too with\\nthe caparison of their horses, they give them breastplates of brass,\\nbut employ gold about the reins, the bit, and the cheek-plates. They\\nuse neither iron nor silver, having none in their country; but they\\nhave brass and gold in abundance. \\n\\nThe following are some of their customs;- Each man has but one wife,\\nyet all the wives are held in common; for this is a custom of the\\nMassagetae and not of the Scythians, as the Greeks wrongly say. Human\\nlife does not come to its natural close with this people; but when\\na man grows very old, all his kinsfolk collect together and offer\\nhim up in sacrifice; offering at the same time some cattle also. After\\nthe sacrifice they boil the flesh and feast on it; and those who thus\\nend their days are reckoned the happiest. If a man dies of disease\\nthey do not eat him, but bury him in the ground, bewailing his ill-fortune\\nthat he did not come to be sacrificed. They sow no grain, but live\\non their herds, and on fish, of which there is great plenty in the\\nAraxes. Milk is what they chiefly drink. The only god they worship\\nis the sun, and to him they offer the horse in sacrifice; under the\\nnotion of giving to the swiftest of the gods the swiftest of all mortal\\ncreatures. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK II\\n\\nEuterpe \\n\\nOn the death of Cyrus, Cambyses his son by Cassandane daughter of\\nPharnaspes took the kingdom. Cassandane had died in the lifetime of\\nCyrus, who had made a great mourning for her at her death, and had\\ncommanded all the subjects of his empire to observe the like. Cambyses,\\nthe son of this lady and of Cyrus, regarding the Ionian and Aeolian\\nGreeks as vassals of his father, took them with him in his expedition\\nagainst Egypt among the other nations which owned his sway.\\n\\nNow the Egyptians, before the reign of their king Psammetichus, believed\\nthemselves to be the most ancient of mankind. Since Psammetichus,\\nhowever, made an attempt to discover who were actually the primitive\\nrace, they have been of opinion that while they surpass all other\\nnations, the Phrygians surpass them in antiquity. This king, finding\\nit impossible to make out by dint of inquiry what men were the most\\nancient, contrived the following method of discovery:- He took two\\nchildren of the common sort, and gave them over to a herdsman to bring\\nup at his folds, strictly charging him to let no one utter a word\\nin their presence, but to keep them in a sequestered cottage, and\\nfrom time to time introduce goats to their apartment, see that they\\ngot their fill of milk, and in all other respects look after them.\\nHis object herein was to know, after the indistinct babblings of infancy\\nwere over, what word they would first articulate. It happened as he\\nhad anticipated. The herdsman obeyed his orders for two years, and\\nat the end of that time, on his one day opening the door of their\\nroom and going in, the children both ran up to him with outstretched\\narms, and distinctly said \"Becos.\" When this first happened the herdsman\\ntook no notice; but afterwards when he observed, on coming often to\\nsee after them, that the word was constantly in their mouths, he informed\\nhis lord, and by his command brought the children into his presence.\\nPsammetichus then himself heard them say the word, upon which he proceeded\\nto make inquiry what people there was who called anything \"becos,\"\\nand hereupon he learnt that \"becos\" was the Phrygian name for bread.\\nIn consideration of this circumstance the Egyptians yielded their\\nclaims, and admitted the greater antiquity of the Phrygians.\\n\\nThat these were the real facts I learnt at Memphis from the priests\\nof Vulcan. The Greeks, among other foolish tales, relate that Psammetichus\\nhad the children brought up by women whose tongues he had previously\\ncut out; but the priests said their bringing up was such as I have\\nstated above. I got much other information also from conversation\\nwith these priests while I was at Memphis, and I even went to Heliopolis\\nand to Thebes, expressly to try whether the priests of those places\\nwould agree in their accounts with the priests at Memphis. The Heliopolitans\\nhave the reputation of being the best skilled in history of all the\\nEgyptians. What they told me concerning their religion it is not my\\nintention to repeat, except the names of their deities, which I believe\\nall men know equally. If I relate anything else concerning these matters,\\nit will only be when compelled to do so by the course of my narrative.\\n\\nNow with regard to mere human matters, the accounts which they gave,\\nand in which all agreed, were the following. The Egyptians, they said,\\nwere the first to discover the solar year, and to portion out its\\ncourse into twelve parts. They obtained this knowledge from the stars.\\n(To my mind they contrive their year much more cleverly than the Greeks,\\nfor these last every other year intercalate a whole month, but the\\nEgyptians, dividing the year into twelve months of thirty days each,\\nadd every year a space of five days besides, whereby the circuit of\\nthe seasons is made to return with uniformity.) The Egyptians, they\\nwent on to affirm, first brought into use the names of the twelve\\ngods, which the Greeks adopted from them; and first erected altars,\\nimages, and temples to the gods; and also first engraved upon stone\\nthe figures of animals. In most of these cases they proved to me that\\nwhat they said was true. And they told me that the first man who ruled\\nover Egypt was Min, and that in his time all Egypt, except the Thebaic\\ncanton, was a marsh, none of the land below Lake Moeris then showing\\nitself above the surface of the water. This is a distance of seven\\ndays\\' sail from the sea up the river. \\n\\nWhat they said of their country seemed to me very reasonable. For\\nany one who sees Egypt, without having heard a word about it before,\\nmust perceive, if he has only common powers of observation, that the\\nEgypt to which the Greeks go in their ships is an acquired country,\\nthe gift of the river. The same is true of the land above the lake,\\nto the distance of three days\\' voyage, concerning which the Egyptians\\nsay nothing, but which exactly the same kind of country.\\n\\nThe following is the general character of the region. In the first\\nplace, on approaching it by sea, when you are still a day\\'s sail from\\nthe land, if you let down a sounding-line you will bring up mud, and\\nfind yourself in eleven fathoms\\' water, which shows that the soil\\nwashed down by the stream extends to that distance. \\n\\nThe length of the country along shore, according to the bounds that\\nwe assign to Egypt, namely from the Plinthinetic gulf to Lake Serbonis,\\nwhich extends along the base of Mount Casius, is sixty schoenes. The\\nnations whose territories are scanty measure them by the fathom; those\\nwhose bounds are less confined, by the furlong; those who have an\\nample territory, by the parasang; but if men have a country which\\nis very vast, they measure it by the schoene. Now the length of the\\nparasang is thirty furlongs, but the schoene, which is an Egyptian\\nmeasure, is sixty furlongs. Thus the coastline of Egypt would extend\\na length of three thousand six hundred furlongs. \\n\\nFrom the coast inland as far as Heliopolis the breadth of Egypt is\\nconsiderable, the country is flat, without springs, and full of swamps.\\nThe length of the route from the sea up to Heliopolis is almost exactly\\nthe same as that of the road which runs from the altar of the twelve\\ngods at Athens to the temple of Olympian Jove at Pisa. If a person\\nmade a calculation he would find but a very little difference between\\nthe two routes, not more than about fifteen furlongs; for the road\\nfrom Athens to Pisa falls short of fifteen hundred furlongs by exactly\\nfifteen, whereas the distance of Heliopolis from the sea is just the\\nround number. \\n\\nAs one proceeds beyond Heliopolis up the country, Egypt becomes narrow,\\nthe Arabian range of hills, which has a direction from north to south,\\nshutting it in upon the one side, and the Libyan range upon the other.\\nThe former ridge runs on without a break, and stretches away to the\\nsea called the Erythraean; it contains the quarries whence the stone\\nwas cut for the pyramids of Memphis: and this is the point where it\\nceases its first direction, and bends away in the manner above indicated.\\nIn its greatest length from east to west it is, as I have been informed,\\na distance of two months\\' journey towards the extreme east its skirts\\nproduce frankincense. Such are the chief features of this range. On\\nthe Libyan side, the other ridge whereon the pyramids stand is rocky\\nand covered with sand; its direction is the same as that of the Arabian\\nridge in the first part of its course. Above Heliopolis, then, there\\nis no great breadth of territory for such a country as Egypt, but\\nduring four days\\' sail Egypt is narrow; the valley between the two\\nranges is a level plain, and seemed to me to be, at the narrowest\\npoint, not more than two hundred furlongs across from the Arabian\\nto the Libyan hills. Above this point Egypt again widens.\\n\\nFrom Heliopolis to Thebes is nine days\\' sail up the river; the distance\\nis eighty-one schoenes, or 4860 furlongs. If we now put together the\\nseveral measurements of the country we shall find that the distance\\nalong shore is, as I stated above, 3600 furlongs, and the distance\\nfrom the sea inland to Thebes 6120 furlongs. Further, it is a distance\\nof eighteen hundred furlongs from Thebes to the place called Elephantine.\\n\\nThe greater portion of the country above described seemed to me to\\nbe, as the priests declared, a tract gained by the inhabitants. For\\nthe whole region above Memphis, lying between the two ranges of hills\\nthat have been spoken of, appeared evidently to have formed at one\\ntime a gulf of the sea. It resembles (to compare small things with\\ngreat) the parts about Ilium and Teuthrania, Ephesus, and the plain\\nof the Maeander. In all these regions the land has been formed by\\nrivers, whereof the greatest is not to compare for size with any one\\nof the five mouths of the Nile. I could mention other rivers also,\\nfar inferior to the Nile in magnitude, that have effected very great\\nchanges. Among these not the least is the Achelous, which, after passing\\nthrough Acarnania, empties itself into the sea opposite the islands\\ncalled Echinades, and has already joined one-half of them to the continent.\\n\\nIn Arabia, not far from Egypt, there is a long and narrow gulf running\\ninland from the sea called the Erythraean, of which I will here set\\ndown the dimensions. Starting from its innermost recess, and using\\na row-boat, you take forty days to reach the open main, while you\\nmay cross the gulf at its widest part in the space of half a day.\\nIn this sea there is an ebb and flow of the tide every day. My opinion\\nis that Egypt was formerly very much such a gulf as this- one gulf\\npenetrated from the sea that washes Egypt on the north, and extended\\nitself towards Ethiopia; another entered from the southern ocean,\\nand stretched towards Syria; the two gulfs ran into the land so as\\nalmost to meet each other, and left between them only a very narrow\\ntract of country. Now if the Nile should choose to divert his waters\\nfrom their present bed into this Arabian gulf, what is there to hinder\\nit from being filled up by the stream within, at the utmost, twenty\\nthousand years? For my part, I think it would be filled in half the\\ntime. How then should not a gulf, even of much greater size, have\\nbeen filled up in the ages that passed before I was born, by a river\\nthat is at once so large and so given to working changes?\\n\\nThus I give credit to those from whom I received this account of Egypt,\\nand am myself, moreover, strongly of the same opinion, since I remarked\\nthat the country projects into the sea further than the neighbouring\\nshores, and I observed that there were shells upon the hills, and\\nthat salt exuded from the soil to such an extent as even to injure\\nthe pyramids; and I noticed also that there is but a single hill in\\nall Egypt where sand is found, namely, the hill above Memphis; and\\nfurther, I found the country to bear no resemblance either to its\\nborderland Arabia, or to Libya- nay, nor even to Syria, which forms\\nthe seaboard of Arabia; but whereas the soil of Libya is, we know,\\nsandy and of a reddish hue, and that of Arabia and Syria inclines\\nto stone and clay, Egypt has a soil that is black and crumbly, as\\nbeing alluvial and formed of the deposits brought down by the river\\nfrom Ethiopia. \\n\\nOne fact which I learnt of the priests is to me a strong evidence\\nof the origin of the country. They said that when Moeris was king,\\nthe Nile overflowed all Egypt below Memphis, as soon as it rose so\\nlittle as eight cubits. Now Moeris had not been dead 900 years at\\nthe time when I heard this of the priests; yet at the present day,\\nunless the river rise sixteen, or, at the very least, fifteen cubits,\\nit does not overflow the lands. It seems to me, therefore, that if\\nthe land goes on rising and growing at this rate, the Egyptians who\\ndwell below Lake Moeris, in the Delta (as it is called) and elsewhere,\\nwill one day, by the stoppage of the inundations, suffer permanently\\nthe fate which they told me they expected would some time or other\\nbefall the Greeks. On hearing that the whole land of Greece is watered\\nby rain from heaven, and not, like their own, inundated by rivers,\\nthey observed- \"Some day the Greeks will be disappointed of their\\ngrand hope, and then they will be wretchedly hungry\"; which was as\\nmuch as to say, \"If God shall some day see fit not to grant the Greeks\\nrain, but shall afflict them with a long drought, the Greeks will\\nbe swept away by a famine, since they have nothing to rely on but\\nrain from Jove, and have no other resource for water.\" \\n\\nAnd certes, in thus speaking of the Greeks the Egyptians say nothing\\nbut what is true. But now let me tell the Egyptians how the case stands\\nwith themselves. If, as I said before, the country below Memphis,\\nwhich is the land that is always rising, continues to increase in\\nheight at the rate at which it has risen in times gone by, how will\\nit be possible for the inhabitants of that region to avoid hunger,\\nwhen they will certainly have no rain, and the river will not be able\\nto overflow their cornlands? At present, it must be confessed, they\\nobtain the fruits of the field with less trouble than any other people\\nin the world, the rest of the Egyptians included, since they have\\nno need to break up the ground with the plough, nor to use the hoe,\\nnor to do any of the work which the rest of mankind find necessary\\nif they are to get a crop; but the husbandman waits till the river\\nhas of its own accord spread itself over the fields and withdrawn\\nagain to its bed, and then sows his plot of ground, and after sowing\\nturns his swine into it- the swine tread in the corn- after which\\nhe has only to await the harvest. The swine serve him also to thrash\\nthe grain, which is then carried to the garner. \\n\\nIf then we choose to adopt the views of the Ionians concerning Egypt,\\nwe must come to the conclusion that the Egyptians had formerly no\\ncountry at all. For the Ionians say that nothing is really Egypt but\\nthe Delta, which extends along shore from the Watch-tower of Perseus,\\nas it is called, to the Pelusiac Salt-Pans, a distance of forty schoenes,\\nand stretches inland as far as the city of Cercasorus, where the Nile\\ndivides into the two streams which reach the sea at Pelusium and Canobus\\nrespectively. The rest of what is accounted Egypt belongs, they say,\\neither to Arabia or Libya. But the Delta, as the Egyptians affirm,\\nand as I myself am persuaded, is formed of the deposits of the river,\\nand has only recently, if I may use the expression, come to light.\\nIf, then, they had formerly no territory at all, how came they to\\nbe so extravagant as to fancy themselves the most ancient race in\\nthe world? Surely there was no need of their making the experiment\\nwith the children to see what language they would first speak. But\\nin truth I do not believe that the Egyptians came into being at the\\nsame time with the Delta, as the Ionians call it; I think they have\\nalways existed ever since the human race began; as the land went on\\nincreasing, part of the population came down into the new country,\\npart remained in their old settlements. In ancient times the Thebais\\nbore the name of Egypt, a district of which the entire circumference\\nis but 6120 furlongs. \\n\\nIf, then, my judgment on these matters be right, the Ionians are mistaken\\nin what they say of Egypt. If, on the contrary, it is they who are\\nright, then I undertake to show that neither the Ionians nor any of\\nthe other Greeks know how to count. For they all say that the earth\\nis divided into three parts, Europe, Asia, and Libya, whereas they\\nought to add a fourth part, the Delta of Egypt, since they do not\\ninclude it either in Asia or Libya. For is it not their theory that\\nthe Nile separates Asia from Libya? As the Nile, therefore, splits\\nin two at the apex of the Delta, the Delta itself must be a separate\\ncountry, not contained in either Asia or Libya. \\n\\nHere I take my leave of the opinions of the Ionians, and proceed to\\ndeliver my own sentiments on these subjects. I consider Egypt to be\\nthe whole country inhabited by the Egyptians, just as Cilicia is the\\ntract occupied by the Cilicians, and Assyria that possessed by the\\nAssyrians. And I regard the only proper boundary-line between Libya\\nand Asia to be that which is marked out by the Egyptian frontier.\\nFor if we take the boundary-line commonly received by the Greeks,\\nwe must regard Egypt as divided, along its whole length from Elephantine\\nand the Cataracts to Cercasorus, into two parts, each belonging to\\na different portion of the world, one to Asia, the other to Libya;\\nsince the Nile divides Egypt in two from the Cataracts to the sea,\\nrunning as far as the city of Cercasorus in a single stream, but at\\nthat point separating into three branches, whereof the one which bends\\neastward is called the Pelusiac mouth, and that which slants to the\\nwest, the Canobic. Meanwhile the straight course of the stream, which\\ncomes down from the upper country and meets the apex of the Delta,\\ncontinues on, dividing the Delta down the middle, and empties itself\\ninto the sea by a mouth, which is as celebrated, and carries as large\\na body of water, as most of the others, the mouth called the Sebennytic.\\nBesides these there are two other mouths which run out of the Sebennytic\\ncalled respectively the Saitic and the Mendesian. The Bolbitine mouth,\\nand the Bucolic, are not natural branches, but channels made by excavation.\\n\\nMy judgment as to the extent of Egypt is confirmed by an oracle delivered\\nat the shrine of Ammon, of which I had no knowledge at all until after\\nI had formed my opinion. It happened that the people of the cities\\nMarea and Apis, who live in the part of Egypt that borders on Libya,\\ntook a dislike to the religious usages of the country concerning sacrificial\\nanimals, and wished no longer to be restricted from eating the flesh\\nof cows. So, as they believed themselves to be Libyans and not Egyptians,\\nthey sent to the shrine to say that, having nothing in common with\\nthe Egyptians, neither inhabiting the Delta nor using the Egyptian\\ntongue, they claimed to be allowed to eat whatever they pleased. Their\\nrequest, however, was refused by the god, who declared in reply that\\nEgypt was the entire tract of country which the Nile overspreads and\\nirrigates, and the Egyptians were the people who lived below Elephantine,\\nand drank the waters of that river. \\n\\nSo said the oracle. Now the Nile, when it overflows, floods not only\\nthe Delta, but also the tracts of country on both sides the stream\\nwhich are thought to belong to Libya and Arabia, in some places reaching\\nto the extent of two days\\' journey from its banks, in some even exceeding\\nthat distance, but in others falling short of it. \\n\\nConcerning the nature of the river, I was not able to gain any information\\neither from the priests or from others. I was particularly anxious\\nto learn from them why the Nile, at the commencement of the summer\\nsolstice, begins to rise, and continues to increase for a hundred\\ndays- and why, as soon as that number is past, it forthwith retires\\nand contracts its stream, continuing low during the whole of the winter\\nuntil the summer solstice comes round again. On none of these points\\ncould I obtain any explanation from the inhabitants, though I made\\nevery inquiry, wishing to know what was commonly reported- they could\\nneither tell me what special virtue the Nile has which makes it so\\nopposite in its nature to all other streams, nor why, unlike every\\nother river, it gives forth no breezes from its surface.\\n\\nSome of the Greeks, however, wishing to get a reputation for cleverness,\\nhave offered explanations of the phenomena of the river, for which\\nthey have accounted in three different ways. Two of these I do not\\nthink it worth while to speak of, further than simply to mention what\\nthey are. One pretends that the Etesian winds cause the rise of the\\nriver by preventing the Nile-water from running off into the sea.\\nBut in the first place it has often happened, when the Etesian winds\\ndid not blow, that the Nile has risen according to its usual wont;\\nand further, if the Etesian winds produced the effect, the other rivers\\nwhich flow in a direction opposite to those winds ought to present\\nthe same phenomena as the Nile, and the more so as they are all smaller\\nstreams, and have a weaker current. But these rivers, of which there\\nare many both in Syria and Libya, are entirely unlike the Nile in\\nthis respect. \\n\\nThe second opinion is even more unscientific than the one just mentioned,\\nand also, if I may so say, more marvellous. It is that the Nile acts\\nso strangely, because it flows from the ocean, and that the ocean\\nflows all round the earth. \\n\\nThe third explanation, which is very much more plausible than either\\nof the others, is positively the furthest from the truth; for there\\nis really nothing in what it says, any more than in the other theories.\\nIt is, that the inundation of the Nile is caused by the melting of\\nsnows. Now, as the Nile flows out of Libya, through Ethiopia, into\\nEgypt, how is it possible that it can be formed of melted snow, running,\\nas it does, from the hottest regions of the world into cooler countries?\\nMany are the proofs whereby any one capable of reasoning on the subject\\nmay be convinced that it is most unlikely this should be the case.\\nThe first and strongest argument is furnished by the winds, which\\nalways blow hot from these regions. The second is that rain and frost\\nare unknown there. Now whenever snow falls, it must of necessity rain\\nwithin five days;.so that, if there were snow, there must be rain\\nalso in those parts. Thirdly, it is certain that the natives of the\\ncountry are black with the heat, that the kites and the swallows remain\\nthere the whole year, and that the cranes, when they fly from the\\nrigours of a Scythian winter, flock thither to pass the cold season.\\nIf then, in the country whence the Nile has its source, or in that\\nthrough which it flows, there fell ever so little snow, it is absolutely\\nimpossible that any of these circumstances could take place.\\n\\nAs for the writer who attributes the phenomenon to the ocean, his\\naccount is involved in such obscurity that it is impossible to disprove\\nit by argument. For my part I know of no river called Ocean, and I\\nthink that Homer, or one of the earlier poets, invented the name,\\nand introduced it into his poetry. \\n\\nPerhaps, after censuring all the opinions that have been put forward\\non this obscure subject, one ought to propose some theory of one\\'s\\nown. I will therefore proceed to explain what I think to be the reason\\nof the Nile\\'s swelling in the summer time. During the winter, the\\nsun is driven out of his usual course by the storms, and removes to\\nthe upper parts of Libya. This is the whole secret in the fewest possible\\nwords; for it stands to reason that the country to which the Sun-god\\napproaches the nearest, and which he passes most directly over, will\\nbe scantest of water, and that there the streams which feed the rivers\\nwill shrink the most. \\n\\nTo explain, however, more at length, the case is this. The sun, in\\nhis passage across the upper parts of Libya, affects them in the following\\nway. As the air in those regions is constantly clear, and the country\\nwarm through the absence of cold winds, the sun in his passage across\\nthem acts upon them exactly as he wont to act elsewhere in summer,\\nwhen his path is in the middle of heaven- that is, he attracts the\\nwater. After attracting it, he again repels it into the upper regions,\\nwhere the winds lay hold of it, scatter it, and reduce it to a vapour,\\nwhence it naturally enough comes to pass that the winds which blow\\nfrom this quarter- the south and south-west- are of all winds the\\nmost rainy. And my own opinion is that the sun does not get rid of\\nall the water which he draws year by year from the Nile, but retains\\nsome about him. When the winter begins to soften, the sun goes back\\nagain to his old place in the middle of the heaven, and proceeds to\\nattract water equally from all countries. Till then the other rivers\\nrun big, from the quantity of rain-water which they bring down from\\ncountries where so much moisture falls that all the land is cut into\\ngullies; but in summer, when the showers fail, and the sun attracts\\ntheir water, they become low. The Nile, on the contrary, not deriving\\nany of its bulk from rains, and being in winter subject to the attraction\\nof the sun, naturally runs at that season, unlike all other streams,\\nwith a less burthen of water than in the summer time. For in summer\\nit is exposed to attraction equally with all other rivers, but in\\nwinter it suffers alone. The sun, therefore, I regard as the sole\\ncause of the phenomenon. \\n\\nIt is the sun also, in my opinion, which, by heating the space through\\nwhich it passes, makes the air in Egypt so dry. There is thus perpetual\\nsummer in the upper parts of Libya. Were the position of the heavenly\\nregions reversed, so that the place where now the north wind and the\\nwinter have their dwelling became the station of the south wind and\\nof the noon-day, while, on the other hand, the station of the south\\nwind became that of the north, the consequence would be that the sun,\\ndriven from the mid-heaven by the winter and the northern gales, would\\nbetake himself to the upper parts of Europe, as he now does to those\\nof Libya, and then I believe his passage across Europe would affect\\nthe Ister exactly as the Nile is affected at the present day.\\n\\nAnd with respect to the fact that no breeze blows from the Nile, I\\nam of opinion that no wind is likely to arise in very hot countries,\\nfor breezes love to blow from some cold quarter. \\n\\nLet us leave these things, however, to their natural course, to continue\\nas they are and have been from the beginning. With regard to the sources\\nof the Nile, I have found no one among all those with whom I have\\nconversed, whether Egyptians, Libyans, or Greeks, who professed to\\nhave any knowledge, except a single person. He was the scribe who\\nkept the register of the sacred treasures of Minerva in the city of\\nSais, and he did not seem to me to be in earnest when he said that\\nhe knew them perfectly well. His story was as follows:- \"Between Syene,\\na city of the Thebais, and Elephantine, there are\" (he said) \"two\\nhills with sharp conical tops; the name of the one is Crophi, of the\\nother, Mophi. Midway between them are the fountains of the Nile, fountains\\nwhich it is impossible to fathom. Half the water runs northward into\\nEgypt, half to the south towards Ethiopia.\" The fountains were known\\nto be unfathomable, he declared, because Psammetichus, an Egyptian\\nking, had made trial of them. He had caused a rope to be made, many\\nthousand fathoms in length, and had sounded the fountain with it,\\nbut could find no bottom. By this the scribe gave me to understand,\\nif there was any truth at all in what he said, that in this fountain\\nthere are certain strong eddies, and a regurgitation, owing to the\\nforce wherewith the water dashes against the mountains, and hence\\na Sounding-line cannot be got to reach the bottom of the spring.\\n\\nNo other information on this head could I obtain from any quarter.\\nAll that I succeeded in learning further of the more distant portions\\nof the Nile, by ascending myself as high as Elephantine and making\\ninquiries concerning the parts beyond, was the following:- As one\\nadvances beyond Elephantine, the land rises. Hence it is necessary\\nin this part of the river to attach a rope to the boat on each side,\\nas men harness an ox, and so proceed on the journey. If the rope snaps,\\nthe vessel is borne away down stream by the force of the current.\\nThe navigation continues the same for four days, the river winding\\ngreatly, like the Maeander, and the distance traversed amounting to\\ntwelve schoenes. Here you come upon a smooth and level plain, where\\nthe Nile flows in two branches, round an island called Tachompso.\\nThe country above Elephantine is inhabited by the Ethiopians, who\\npossess one-half of this island, the Egyptians occupying the other.\\nAbove the island there is a great lake, the shores of which are inhabited\\nby Ethiopian nomads; after passing it, you come again to the stream\\nof the Nile, which runs into the lake. Here you land, and travel for\\nforty days along the banks of the river, since it is impossible to\\nproceed further in a boat on account of the sharp peaks which jut\\nout from the water, and the sunken rocks which abound in that part\\nof the stream. When you have passed this portion of the river in the\\nspace of forty days, you go on board another boat and proceed by water\\nfor twelve days more, at the end of which time you reach a great city\\ncalled Meroe, which is said to be the capital of the other Ethiopians.\\nThe only gods worshipped by the inhabitants are Jupiter and Bacchus,\\nto whom great honours are paid. There is an oracle of Jupiter in the\\ncity, which directs the warlike expeditions of the Ethiopians; when\\nit commands they go to war, and in whatever direction it bids them\\nmarch, thither straightway they carry their arms. \\n\\nOn leaving this city, and again mounting the stream, in the same space\\nof time which it took you to reach the capital from Elephantine, you\\ncome to the Deserters, who bear the name of Asmach. This word, translated\\ninto our language, means \"the men who stand on the left hand of the\\nking.\" These Deserters are Egyptians of the warrior caste, who, to\\nthe number of two hundred and forty thousand, went over to the Ethiopians\\nin the reign of king Psammetichus. The cause of their desertion was\\nthe following:- Three garrisons were maintained in Egypt at that time,\\none in the city of Elephantine against the Ethiopians, another in\\nthe Pelusiac Daphnae, against the Syrians and Arabians, and a third,\\nagainst the Libyans, in Marea. (The very same posts are to this day\\noccupied by the Persians, whose forces are in garrison both in Daphnae\\nand in Elephantine.) Now it happened, that on one occasion the garrisons\\nwere not relieved during the space of three years; the soldiers, therefore,\\nat the end of that time, consulted together, and having determined\\nby common consent to revolt, marched away towards Ethiopia. Psammetichus,\\ninformed of the movement, set out in pursuit, and coming up with them,\\nbesought them with many words not to desert the gods of their country,\\nnor abandon their wives and children. \"Nay, but,\" said one of the\\ndeserters with an unseemly gesture, \"wherever we go, we are sure enough\\nof finding wives and children.\" Arrived in Ethiopia, they placed themselves\\nat the disposal of the king. In return, he made them a present of\\na tract of land which belonged to certain Ethiopians with whom he\\nwas at feud, bidding them expel the inhabitants and take possession\\nof their territory. From the time that this settlement was formed,\\ntheir acquaintance with Egyptian manners has tended to civilise the\\nEthiopians. \\n\\nThus the course of the Nile is known, not only throughout Egypt, but\\nto the extent of four months\\' journey either by land or water above\\nthe Egyptian boundary; for on calculation it will be found that it\\ntakes that length of time to travel from Elephantine to the country\\nof the Deserters. There the direction of the river is from west to\\neast. Beyond, no one has any certain knowledge of its course, since\\nthe country is uninhabited by reason of the excessive heat.\\n\\nI did hear, indeed, what I will now relate, from certain natives of\\nCyrene. Once upon a time, they said, they were on a visit to the oracular\\nshrine of Ammon, when it chanced that in the course of conversation\\nwith Etearchus, the Ammonian king, the talk fell upon the Nile, how\\nthat its sources were unknown to all men. Etearchus upon this mentioned\\nthat some Nasamonians had once come to his court, and when asked if\\nthey could give any information concerning the uninhabited parts of\\nLibya, had told the following tale. (The Nasamonians are a Libyan\\nrace who occupy the Syrtis, and a tract of no great size towards the\\neast.) They said there had grown up among them some wild young men,\\nthe sons of certain chiefs, who, when they came to man\\'s estate, indulged\\nin all manner of extravagancies, and among other things drew lots\\nfor five of their number to go and explore the desert parts of Libya,\\nand try if they could not penetrate further than any had done previously.\\nThe coast of Libya along the sea which washes it to the north, throughout\\nits entire length from Egypt to Cape Soloeis, which is its furthest\\npoint, is inhabited by Libyans of many distinct tribes who possess\\nthe whole tract except certain portions which belong to the Phoenicians\\nand the Greeks. Above the coast-line and the country inhabited by\\nthe maritime tribes, Libya is full of wild beasts; while beyond the\\nwild beast region there is a tract which is wholly sand, very scant\\nof water, and utterly and entirely a desert. The young men therefore,\\ndespatched on this errand by their comrades with a plentiful supply\\nof water and provisions, travelled at first through the inhabited\\nregion, passing which they came to the wild beast tract, whence they\\nfinally entered upon the desert, which they proceeded to cross in\\na direction from east to west. After journeying for many days over\\na wide extent of sand, they came at last to a plain where they observed\\ntrees growing; approaching them, and seeing fruit on them, they proceeded\\nto gather it. While they were thus engaged, there came upon them some\\ndwarfish men, under the middle height, who seized them and carried\\nthem off. The Nasamonians could not understand a word of their language,\\nnor had they any acquaintance with the language of the Nasamonians.\\nThey were led across extensive marshes, and finally came to a town,\\nwhere all the men were of the height of their conductors, and black-complexioned.\\nA great river flowed by the town, running from west to east, and containing\\ncrocodiles. \\n\\nHere let me dismiss Etearchus the Ammonian, and his story, only adding\\nthat (according to the Cyrenaeans) he declared that the Nasamonians\\ngot safe back to their country, and that the men whose city they had\\nreached were a nation of sorcerers. With respect to the river which\\nran by their town, Etearchus conjectured it to be the Nile; and reason\\nfavours that view. For the Nile certainly flows out of Libya, dividing\\nit down the middle, and as I conceive, judging the unknown from the\\nknown, rises at the same distance from its mouth as the Ister. This\\nlatter river has its source in the country of the Celts near the city\\nPyrene, and runs through the middle of Europe, dividing it into two\\nportions. The Celts live beyond the pillars of Hercules, and border\\non the Cynesians, who dwell at the extreme west of Europe. Thus the\\nIster flows through the whole of Europe before it finally empties\\nitself into the Euxine at Istria, one of the colonies of the Milesians.\\n\\nNow as this river flows through regions that are inhabited, its course\\nis perfectly well known; but of the sources of the Nile no one can\\ngive any account, since Libya, the country through which it passes,\\nis desert and without inhabitants. As far as it was possible to get\\ninformation by inquiry, I have given a description of the stream.\\nIt enters Egypt from the parts beyond. Egypt lies almost exactly opposite\\nthe mountainous portion of Cilicia, whence a lightly-equipped traveller\\nmay reach Sinope on the Euxine in five days by the direct route. Sinope\\nlies opposite the place where the Ister falls into the sea. My opinion\\ntherefore is that the Nile, as it traverses the whole of Libya, is\\nof equal length with the Ister. And here I take my leave of this subject.\\n\\nConcerning Egypt itself I shall extend my remarks to a great length,\\nbecause there is no country that possesses so many wonders, nor any\\nthat has such a number of works which defy description. Not only is\\nthe climate different from that of the rest of the world, and the\\nrivers unlike any other rivers, but the people also, in most of their\\nmanners and customs, exactly reverse the common practice of mankind.\\nThe women attend the markets and trade, while the men sit at home\\nat the loom; and here, while the rest of the world works the woof\\nup the warp, the Egyptians work it down; the women likewise carry\\nburthens upon their shoulders, while the men carry them upon their\\nheads. They eat their food out of doors in the streets, but retire\\nfor private purposes to their houses, giving as a reason that what\\nis unseemly, but necessary, ought to be done in secret, but what has\\nnothing unseemly about it, should be done openly. A woman cannot serve\\nthe priestly office, either for god or goddess, but men are priests\\nto both; sons need not support their parents unless they choose, but\\ndaughters must, whether they choose or no. \\n\\nIn other countries the priests have long hair, in Egypt their heads\\nare shaven; elsewhere it is customary, in mourning, for near relations\\nto cut their hair close: the Egyptians, who wear no hair at any other\\ntime, when they lose a relative, let their beards and the hair of\\ntheir heads grow long. All other men pass their lives separate from\\nanimals, the Egyptians have animals always living with them; others\\nmake barley and wheat their food; it is a disgrace to do so in Egypt,\\nwhere the grain they live on is spelt, which some call zea. Dough\\nthey knead with their feet; but they mix mud, and even take up dirt,\\nwith their hands. They are the only people in the world- they at least,\\nand such as have learnt the practice from them- who use circumcision.\\nTheir men wear two garments apiece, their women but one. They put\\non the rings and fasten the ropes to sails inside; others put them\\noutside. When they write or calculate, instead of going, like the\\nGreeks, from left to right, they move their hand from right to left;\\nand they insist, notwithstanding, that it is they who go to the right,\\nand the Greeks who go to the left. They have two quite different kinds\\nof writing, one of which is called sacred, the other common.\\n\\nThey are religious to excess, far beyond any other race of men, and\\nuse the following ceremonies:- They drink out of brazen cups, which\\nthey scour every day: there is no exception to this practice. They\\nwear linen garments, which they are specially careful to have always\\nfresh washed. They practise circumcision for the sake of cleanliness,\\nconsidering it better to be cleanly than comely. The priests shave\\ntheir whole body every other day, that no lice or other impure thing\\nmay adhere to them when they are engaged in the service of the gods.\\nTheir dress is entirely of linen, and their shoes of the papyrus plant:\\nit is not lawful for them to wear either dress or shoes of any other\\nmaterial. They bathe twice every day in cold water, and twice each\\nnight; besides which they observe, so to speak, thousands of ceremonies.\\nThey enjoy, however, not a few advantages. They consume none of their\\nown property, and are at no expense for anything; but every day bread\\nis baked for them of the sacred corn, and a plentiful supply of beef\\nand of goose\\'s flesh is assigned to each, and also a portion of wine\\nmade from the grape. Fish they are not allowed to eat; and beans-\\nwhich none of the Egyptians ever sow, or eat, if they come up of their\\nown accord, either raw or boiled- the priests will not even endure\\nto look on, since they consider it an unclean kind of pulse. Instead\\nof a single priest, each god has the attendance of a college, at the\\nhead of which is a chief priest; when one of these dies, his son is\\nappointed in his room. \\n\\nMale kine are reckoned to belong to Epaphus, and are therefore tested\\nin the following manner:- One of the priests appointed for the purpose\\nsearches to see if there is a single black hair on the whole body,\\nsince in that case the beast is unclean. He examines him all over,\\nstanding on his legs, and again laid upon his back; after which he\\ntakes the tongue out of his mouth, to see if it be clean in respect\\nof the prescribed marks (what they are I will mention elsewhere);\\nhe also inspects the hairs of the tail, to observe if they grow naturally.\\nIf the animal is pronounced clean in all these various points, the\\npriest marks him by twisting a piece of papyrus round his horns, and\\nattaching thereto some sealing-clay, which he then stamps with his\\nown signet-ring. After this the beast is led away; and it is forbidden,\\nunder the penalty of death, to sacrifice an animal which has not been\\nmarked in this way. \\n\\nThe following is their manner of sacrifice:- They lead the victim,\\nmarked with their signet, to the altar where they are about to offer\\nit, and setting the wood alight, pour a libation of wine upon the\\naltar in front of the victim, and at the same time invoke the god.\\nThen they slay the animal, and cutting off his head, proceed to flay\\nthe body. Next they take the head, and heaping imprecations on it,\\nif there is a market-place and a body of Greek traders in the city,\\nthey carry it there and sell it instantly; if, however, there are\\nno Greeks among them, they throw the head into the river. The imprecation\\nis to this effect:- They pray that if any evil is impending either\\nover those who sacrifice, or over universal Egypt, it may be made\\nto fall upon that head. These practices, the imprecations upon the\\nheads, and the libations of wine, prevail all over Egypt, and extend\\nto victims of all sorts; and hence the Egyptians will never eat the\\nhead of any animal. \\n\\nThe disembowelling and burning are, however, different in different\\nsacrifices. I will mention the mode in use with respect to the goddess\\nwhom they regard as the greatest, and honour with the chiefest festival.\\nWhen they have flayed their steer they pray, and when their prayer\\nis ended they take the paunch of the animal out entire, leaving the\\nintestines and the fat inside the body; they then cut off the legs,\\nthe ends of the loins, the shoulders, and the neck; and having so\\ndone, they fill the body of the steer with clean bread, honey, raisins,\\nfigs, frankincense, myrrh, and other aromatics. Thus filled, they\\nburn the body, pouring over it great quantities of oil. Before offering\\nthe sacrifice they fast, and while the bodies of the victims are being\\nconsumed they beat themselves. Afterwards, when they have concluded\\nthis part of the ceremony, they have the other parts of the victim\\nserved up to them for a repast. \\n\\nThe male kine, therefore, if clean, and the male calves, are used\\nfor sacrifice by the Egyptians universally; but the females they are\\nnot allowed to sacrifice, since they are sacred to Isis. The statue\\nof this goddess has the form of a woman but with horns like a cow,\\nresembling thus the Greek representations of Io; and the Egyptians,\\none and all, venerate cows much more highly than any other animal.\\nThis is the reason why no native of Egypt, whether man or woman, will\\ngive a Greek a kiss, or use the knife of a Greek, or his spit, or\\nhis cauldron, or taste the flesh of an ox, known to be pure, if it\\nhas been cut with a Greek knife. When kine die, the following is the\\nmanner of their sepulture:- The females are thrown into the river;\\nthe males are buried in the suburbs of the towns, with one or both\\nof their horns appearing above the surface of the ground to mark the\\nplace. When the bodies are decayed, a boat comes, at an appointed\\ntime, from the island called Prosopitis,- which is a portion of the\\nDelta, nine schoenes in circumference,- and calls at the several cities\\nin turn to collect the bones of the oxen. Prosopitis is a district\\ncontaining several cities; the name of that from which the boats come\\nis Atarbechis. Venus has a temple there of much sanctity. Great numbers\\nof men go forth from this city and proceed to the other towns, where\\nthey dig up the bones, which they take away with them and bury together\\nin one place. The same practice prevails with respect to the interment\\nof all other cattle- the law so determining; they do not slaughter\\nany of them. \\n\\nSuch Egyptians as possess a temple of the Theban Jove, or live in\\nthe Thebaic canton, offer no sheep in sacrifice, but only goats; for\\nthe Egyptians do not all worship the same gods, excepting Isis and\\nOsiris, the latter of whom they say is the Grecian Bacchus. Those,\\non the contrary, who possess a temple dedicated to Mendes, or belong\\nto the Mendesian canton, abstain from offering goats, and sacrifice\\nsheep instead. The Thebans, and such as imitate them in their practice,\\ngive the following account of the origin of the custom:- \"Hercules,\"\\nthey say, \"wished of all things to see Jove, but Jove did not choose\\nto be seen of him. At length, when Hercules persisted, Jove hit on\\na device- to flay a ram, and, cutting off his head, hold the head\\nbefore him, and cover himself with the fleece. In this guise he showed\\nhimself to Hercules.\" Therefore the Egyptians give their statues of\\nJupiter the face of a ram: and from them the practice has passed to\\nthe Ammonians, who are a joint colony of Egyptians and Ethiopians,\\nspeaking a language between the two; hence also, in my opinion, the\\nlatter people took their name of Ammonians, since the Egyptian name\\nfor Jupiter is Amun. Such, then, is the reason why the Thebans do\\nnot sacrifice rams, but consider them sacred animals. Upon one day\\nin the year, however, at the festival of Jupiter, they slay a single\\nram, and stripping off the fleece, cover with it the statue of that\\ngod, as he once covered himself, and then bring up to the statue of\\nJove an image of Hercules. When this has been done, the whole assembly\\nbeat their breasts in mourning for the ram, and afterwards bury him\\nin a holy sepulchre. \\n\\nThe account which I received of this Hercules makes him one of the\\ntwelve gods. Of the other Hercules, with whom the Greeks are familiar,\\nI could hear nothing in any part of Egypt. That the Greeks, however\\n(those I mean who gave the son of Amphitryon that name), took the\\nname from the Egyptians, and not the Egyptians from the Greeks, is\\nI think clearly proved, among other arguments, by the fact that both\\nthe parents of Hercules, Amphitryon as well as Alcmena, were of Egyptian\\norigin. Again, the Egyptians disclaim all knowledge of the names of\\nNeptune and the Dioscuri, and do not include them in the number of\\ntheir gods; but had they adopted the name of any god from the Greeks,\\nthese would have been the likeliest to obtain notice, since the Egyptians,\\nas I am well convinced, practised navigation at that time, and the\\nGreeks also were some of them mariners, so that they would have been\\nmore likely to know the names of these gods than that of Hercules.\\nBut the Egyptian Hercules is one of their ancient gods. Seventeen\\nthousand years before the reign of Amasis, the twelve gods were, they\\naffirm, produced from the eight: and of these twelve, Hercules is\\none. \\n\\nIn the wish to get the best information that I could on these matters,\\nI made a voyage to Tyre in Phoenicia, hearing there was a temple of\\nHercules at that place, very highly venerated. I visited the temple,\\nand found it richly adorned with a number of offerings, among which\\nwere two pillars, one of pure gold, the other of emerald, shining\\nwith great brilliancy at night. In a conversation which I held with\\nthe priests, I inquired how long their temple had been built, and\\nfound by their answer that they, too, differed from the Greeks. They\\nsaid that the temple was built at the same time that the city was\\nfounded, and that the foundation of the city took place two thousand\\nthree hundred years ago. In Tyre I remarked another temple where the\\nsame god was worshipped as the Thasian Hercules. So I went on to Thasos,\\nwhere I found a temple of Hercules which had been built by the Phoenicians\\nwho colonised that island when they sailed in search of Europa. Even\\nthis was five generations earlier than the time when Hercules, son\\nof Amphitryon, was born in Greece. These researches show plainly that\\nthere is an ancient god Hercules; and my own opinion is that those\\nGreeks act most wisely who build and maintain two temples of Hercules,\\nin the one of which the Hercules worshipped is known by the name of\\nOlympian, and has sacrifice offered to him as an immortal, while in\\nthe other the honours paid are such as are due to a hero.\\n\\nThe Greeks tell many tales without due investigation, and among them\\nthe following silly fable respecting Hercules:- \"Hercules,\" they say,\\n\"went once to Egypt, and there the inhabitants took him, and putting\\na chaplet on his head, led him out in solemn procession, intending\\nto offer him a sacrifice to Jupiter. For a while he submitted quietly;\\nbut when they led him up to the altar and began the ceremonies, he\\nput forth his strength and slew them all.\" Now to me it seems that\\nsuch a story proves the Greeks to be utterly ignorant of the character\\nand customs of the people. The Egyptians do not think it allowable\\neven to sacrifice cattle, excepting sheep, and the male kine and calves,\\nprovided they be pure, and also geese. How, then, can it be believed\\nthat they would sacrifice men? And again, how would it have been possible\\nfor Hercules alone, and, as they confess, a mere mortal, to destroy\\nso many thousands? In saying thus much concerning these matters, may\\nI incur no displeasure either of god or hero! \\n\\nI mentioned above that some of the Egyptians abstain from sacrificing\\ngoats, either male or female. The reason is the following:- These\\nEgyptians, who are the Mendesians, consider Pan to be one of the eight\\ngods who existed before the twelve, and Pan is represented in Egypt\\nby the painters and the sculptors, just as he is in Greece, with the\\nface and legs of a goat. They do not, however, believe this to be\\nhis shape, or consider him in any respect unlike the other gods; but\\nthey represent him thus for a reason which I prefer not to relate.\\nThe Mendesians hold all goats in veneration, but the male more than\\nthe female, giving the goatherds of the males especial honour. One\\nis venerated more highly than all the rest, and when he dies there\\nis a great mourning throughout all the Mendesian canton. In Egyptian,\\nthe goat and Pan are both called Mendes. \\n\\nThe pig is regarded among them as an unclean animal, so much so that\\nif a man in passing accidentally touch a pig, he instantly hurries\\nto the river, and plunges in with all his clothes on. Hence, too,\\nthe swineherds, notwithstanding that they are of pure Egyptian blood,\\nare forbidden to enter into any of the temples, which are open to\\nall other Egyptians; and further, no one will give his daughter in\\nmarriage to a swineherd, or take a wife from among them, so that the\\nswineherds are forced to intermarry among themselves. They do not\\noffer swine in sacrifice to any of their gods, excepting Bacchus and\\nthe Moon, whom they honour in this way at the same time, sacrificing\\npigs to both of them at the same full moon, and afterwards eating\\nof the flesh. There is a reason alleged by them for their detestation\\nof swine at all other seasons, and their use of them at this festival,\\nwith which I am well acquainted, but which I do not think it proper\\nto mention. The following is the mode in which they sacrifice the\\nswine to the Moon:- As soon as the victim is slain, the tip of the\\ntail, the spleen, and the caul are put together, and having been covered\\nwith all the fat that has been found in the animal\\'s belly, are straightway\\nburnt. The remainder of the flesh is eaten on the same day that the\\nsacrifice is offered, which is the day of the full moon: at any other\\ntime they would not so much as taste it. The poorer sort, who cannot\\nafford live pigs, form pigs of dough, which they bake and offer in\\nsacrifice. \\n\\nTo Bacchus, on the eve of his feast, every Egyptian sacrifices a hog\\nbefore the door of his house, which is then given back to the swineherd\\nby whom it was furnished, and by him carried away. In other respects\\nthe festival is celebrated almost exactly as Bacchic festivals are\\nin Greece, excepting that the Egyptians have no choral dances. They\\nalso use instead of phalli another invention, consisting of images\\na cubit high, pulled by strings, which the women carry round to the\\nvillages. A piper goes in front, and the women follow, singing hymns\\nin honour of Bacchus. They give a religious reason for the peculiarities\\nof the image. \\n\\nMelampus, the son of Amytheon, cannot (I think) have been ignorant\\nof this ceremony- nay, he must, I should conceive, have been well\\nacquainted with it. He it was who introduced into Greece the name\\nof Bacchus, the ceremonial of his worship, and the procession of the\\nphallus. He did not, however, so completely apprehend the whole doctrine\\nas to be able to communicate it entirely, but various sages since\\nhis time have carried out his teaching to greater perfection. Still\\nit is certain that Melampus introduced the phallus, and that the Greeks\\nlearnt from him the ceremonies which they now practise. I therefore\\nmaintain that Melampus, who was a wise man, and had acquired the art\\nof divination, having become acquainted with the worship of Bacchus\\nthrough knowledge derived from Egypt, introduced it into Greece, with\\na few slight changes, at the same time that he brought in various\\nother practices. For I can by no means allow that it is by mere coincidence\\nthat the Bacchic ceremonies in Greece are so nearly the same as the\\nEgyptian- they would then have been more Greek in their character,\\nand less recent in their origin. Much less can I admit that the Egyptians\\nborrowed these customs, or any other, from the Greeks. My belief is\\nthat Melampus got his knowledge of them from Cadmus the Tyrian, and\\nthe followers whom he brought from Phoenicia into the country which\\nis now called Boeotia. \\n\\nAlmost all the names of the gods came into Greece from Egypt. My inquiries\\nprove that they were all derived from a foreign source, and my opinion\\nis that Egypt furnished the greater number. For with the exception\\nof Neptune and the Dioscuri, whom I mentioned above, and Juno, Vesta,\\nThemis, the Graces, and the Nereids, the other gods have been known\\nfrom time immemorial in Egypt. This I assert on the authority of the\\nEgyptians themselves. The gods, with whose names they profess themselves\\nunacquainted, the Greeks received, I believe, from the Pelasgi, except\\nNeptune. Of him they got their knowledge from the Libyans, by whom\\nhe has been always honoured, and who were anciently the only people\\nthat had a god of the name. The Egyptians differ from the Greeks also\\nin paying no divine honours to heroes. \\n\\nBesides these which have been here mentioned, there are many other\\npractices whereof I shall speak hereafter, which the Greeks have borrowed\\nfrom Egypt. The peculiarity, however, which they observe in their\\nstatues of Mercury they did not derive from the Egyptians, but from\\nthe Pelasgi; from them the Athenians first adopted it, and afterwards\\nit passed from the Athenians to the other Greeks. For just at the\\ntime when the Athenians were entering into the Hellenic body, the\\nPelasgi came to live with them in their country, whence it was that\\nthe latter came first to be regarded as Greeks. Whoever has been initiated\\ninto the mysteries of the Cabiri will understand what I mean. The\\nSamothracians received these mysteries from the Pelasgi, who, before\\nthey went to live in Attica, were dwellers in Samothrace, and imparted\\ntheir religious ceremonies to the inhabitants. The Athenians, then,\\nwho were the first of all the Greeks to make their statues of Mercury\\nin this way, learnt the practice from the Pelasgians; and by this\\npeople a religious account of the matter is given, which is explained\\nin the Samothracian mysteries. \\n\\nIn early times the Pelasgi, as I know by information which I got at\\nDodona, offered sacrifices of all kinds, and prayed to the gods, but\\nhad no distinct names or appellations for them, since they had never\\nheard of any. They called them gods (Theoi, disposers), because they\\ndisposed and arranged all things in such a beautiful order. After\\na long lapse of time the names of the gods came to Greece from Egypt,\\nand the Pelasgi learnt them, only as yet they knew nothing of Bacchus,\\nof whom they first heard at a much later date. Not long after the\\narrival of the names they sent to consult the oracle at Dodona about\\nthem. This is the most ancient oracle in Greece, and at that time\\nthere was no other. To their question, \"Whether they should adopt\\nthe names that had been imported from the foreigners?\" the oracle\\nreplied by recommending their use. Thenceforth in their sacrifices\\nthe Pelasgi made use of the names of the gods, and from them the names\\npassed afterwards to the Greeks. \\n\\nWhence the gods severally sprang, whether or no they had all existed\\nfrom eternity, what forms they bore- these are questions of which\\nthe Greeks knew nothing until the other day, so to speak. For Homer\\nand Hesiod were the first to compose Theogonies, and give the gods\\ntheir epithets, to allot them their several offices and occupations,\\nand describe their forms; and they lived but four hundred years before\\nmy time, as I believe. As for the poets who are thought by some to\\nbe earlier than these, they are, in my judgment, decidedly later writers.\\nIn these matters I have the authority of the priestesses of Dodona\\nfor the former portion of my statements; what I have said of Homer\\nand Hesiod is my own opinion. \\n\\nThe following tale is commonly told in Egypt concerning the oracle\\nof Dodona in Greece, and that of Ammon in Libya. My informants on\\nthe point were the priests of Jupiter at Thebes. They said \"that two\\nof the sacred women were once carried off from Thebes by the Phoenicians,\\nand that the story went that one of them was sold into Libya, and\\nthe other into Greece, and these women were the first founders of\\nthe oracles in the two countries.\" On my inquiring how they came to\\nknow so exactly what became of the women, they answered, \"that diligent\\nsearch had been made after them at the time, but that it had not been\\nfound possible to discover where they were; afterwards, however, they\\nreceived the information which they had given me.\" \\n\\nThis was what I heard from the priests at Thebes; at Dodona, however,\\nthe women who deliver the oracles relate the matter as follows:- \"Two\\nblack doves flew away from Egyptian Thebes, and while one directed\\nits flight to Libya, the other came to them. She alighted on an oak,\\nand sitting there began to speak with a human voice, and told them\\nthat on the spot where she was, there should henceforth be an oracle\\nof Jove. They understood the announcement to be from heaven, so they\\nset to work at once and erected the shrine. The dove which flew to\\nLibya bade the Libyans to establish there the oracle of Ammon.\" This\\nlikewise is an oracle of Jupiter. The persons from whom I received\\nthese particulars were three priestesses of the Dodonaeans, the eldest\\nPromeneia, the next Timarete, and the youngest Nicandra- what they\\nsaid was confirmed by the other Dodonaeans who dwell around the temple.\\n\\nMy own opinion of these matters is as follows:- I think that, if it\\nbe true that the Phoenicians carried off the holy women, and sold\\nthem for slaves, the one into Libya and the other into Greece, or\\nPelasgia (as it was then called), this last must have been sold to\\nthe Thesprotians. Afterwards, while undergoing servitude in those\\nparts, she built under a real oak a temple to Jupiter, her thoughts\\nin her new abode reverting- as it was likely they would do, if she\\nhad been an attendant in a temple of Jupiter at Thebes- to that particular\\ngod. Then, having acquired a knowledge of the Greek tongue, she set\\nup an oracle. She also mentioned that her sister had been sold for\\na slave into Libya by the same persons as herself. \\n\\nThe Dodonaeans called the women doves because they were foreigners,\\nand seemed to them to make a noise like birds. After a while the dove\\nspoke with a human voice, because the woman, whose foreign talk had\\npreviously sounded to them like the chattering of a bird, acquired\\nthe power of speaking what they could understand. For how can it be\\nconceived possible that a dove should really speak with the voice\\nof a man? Lastly, by calling the dove black the Dodonaeans indicated\\nthat the woman was an Egyptian. And certainly the character of the\\noracles at Thebes and Dodona is very similar. Besides this form of\\ndivination, the Greeks learnt also divination by means of victims\\nfrom the Egyptians. \\n\\nThe Egyptians were also the first to introduce solemn assemblies,\\nprocessions, and litanies to the gods; of all which the Greeks were\\ntaught the use by them. It seems to me a sufficient proof of this\\nthat in Egypt these practices have been established from remote antiquity,\\nwhile in Greece they are only recently known. \\n\\nThe Egyptians do not hold a single solemn assembly, but several in\\nthe course of the year. Of these the chief, which is better attended\\nthan any other, is held at the city of Bubastis in honour of Diana.\\nThe next in importance is that which takes place at Busiris, a city\\nsituated in the very middle of the Delta; it is in honour of Isis,\\nwho is called in the Greek tongue Demiter (Ceres). There is a third\\ngreat festival in Sais to Minerva, a fourth in Heliopolis to the Sun,\\na fifth in Buto to Latona, and a sixth in Papremis to Mars.\\n\\nThe following are the proceedings on occasion of the assembly at Bubastis:-\\nMen and women come sailing all together, vast numbers in each boat,\\nmany of the women with castanets, which they strike, while some of\\nthe men pipe during the whole time of the voyage; the remainder of\\nthe voyagers, male and female, sing the while, and make a clapping\\nwith their hands. When they arrive opposite any of the towns upon\\nthe banks of the stream, they approach the shore, and, while some\\nof the women continue to play and sing, others call aloud to the females\\nof the place and load them with abuse, while a certain number dance,\\nand some standing up uncover themselves. After proceeding in this\\nway all along the river-course, they reach Bubastis, where they celebrate\\nthe feast with abundant sacrifices. More grape-wine is consumed at\\nthis festival than in all the rest of the year besides. The number\\nof those who attend, counting only the men and women and omitting\\nthe children, amounts, according to the native reports, to seven hundred\\nthousand. \\n\\nThe ceremonies at the feast of Isis in the city of Busiris have been\\nalready spoken of. It is there that the whole multitude, both of men\\nand women, many thousands in number, beat themselves at the close\\nof the sacrifice, in honour of a god, whose name a religious scruple\\nforbids me to mention. The Carian dwellers in Egypt proceed on this\\noccasion to still greater lengths, even cutting their faces with their\\nknives, whereby they let it been seen that they are not Egyptians\\nbut foreigners. \\n\\nAt Sais, when the assembly takes place for the sacrifices, there is\\none night on which the inhabitants all burn a multitude of lights\\nin the open air round their houses. They use lamps in the shape of\\nflat saucers filled with a mixture of oil and salt, on the top of\\nwhich the wick floats. These burn the whole night, and give to the\\nfestival the name of the Feast of Lamps. The Egyptians who are absent\\nfrom the festival observe the night of the sacrifice, no less than\\nthe rest, by a general lighting of lamps; so that the illumination\\nis not confined to the city of Sais, but extends over the whole of\\nEgypt. And there is a religious reason assigned for the special honour\\npaid to this night, as well as for the illumination which accompanies\\nit. \\n\\nAt Heliopolis and Buto the assemblies are merely for the purpose of\\nsacrifice; but at Papremis, besides the sacrifices and other rites\\nwhich are performed there as elsewhere, the following custom is observed:-\\nWhen the sun is getting low, a few only of the priests continue occupied\\nabout the image of the god, while the greater number, armed with wooden\\nclubs, take their station at the portal of the temple. Opposite to\\nthem is drawn up a body of men, in number above a thousand, armed,\\nlike the others, with clubs, consisting of persons engaged in the\\nperformance of their vows. The image of the god, which is kept in\\na small wooden shrine covered with plates of gold, is conveyed from\\nthe temple into a second sacred building the day before the festival\\nbegins. The few priests still in attendance upon the image place it,\\ntogether with the shrine containing it, on a four-wheeled car, and\\nbegin to drag it along; the others stationed at the gateway of the\\ntemple, oppose its admission. Then the votaries come forward to espouse\\nthe quarrel of the god, and set upon the opponents, who are sure to\\noffer resistance. A sharp fight with clubs ensues, in which heads\\nare commonly broken on both sides. Many, I am convinced, die of the\\nwounds that they receive, though the Egyptians insist that no one\\nis ever killed. \\n\\nThe natives give the subjoined account of this festival. They say\\nthat the mother of the god Mars once dwelt in the temple. Brought\\nup at a distance from his parent, when he grew to man\\'s estate he\\nconceived a wish to visit her. Accordingly he came, but the attendants,\\nwho had never seen him before, refused him entrance, and succeeded\\nin keeping him out. So he went to another city and collected a body\\nof men, with whose aid he handled the attendants very roughly, and\\nforced his way in to his mother. Hence they say arose the custom of\\na fight with sticks in honour of Mars at this festival. \\n\\nThe Egyptians first made it a point of religion to have no converse\\nwith women in the sacred places, and not to enter them without washing,\\nafter such converse. Almost all other nations, except the Greeks and\\nthe Egyptians, act differently, regarding man as in this matter under\\nno other law than the brutes. Many animals, they say, and various\\nkinds of birds, may be seen to couple in the temples and the sacred\\nprecincts, which would certainly not happen if the gods were displeased\\nat it. Such are the arguments by which they defend their practice,\\nbut I nevertheless can by no means approve of it. In these points\\nthe Egyptians are specially careful, as they are indeed in everything\\nwhich concerns their sacred edifices. \\n\\nEgypt, though it borders upon Libya, is not a region abounding in\\nwild animals. The animals that do exist in the country, whether domesticated\\nor otherwise, are all regarded as sacred. If I were to explain why\\nthey are consecrated to the several gods, I should be led to speak\\nof religious matters, which I particularly shrink from mentioning;\\nthe points whereon I have touched slightly hitherto have all been\\nintroduced from sheer necessity. Their custom with respect to animals\\nis as follows:- For every kind there are appointed certain guardians,\\nsome male, some female, whose business it is to look after them; and\\nthis honour is made to descend from father to son. The inhabitants\\nof the various cities, when they have made a vow to any god, pay it\\nto his animals in the way which I will now explain. At the time of\\nmaking the vow they shave the head of the child, cutting off all the\\nhair, or else half, or sometimes a third part, which they then weigh\\nin a balance against a sum of silver; and whatever sum the hair weighs\\nis presented to the guardian of the animals, who thereupon cuts up\\nsome fish, and gives it to them for food- such being the stuff whereon\\nthey are fed. When a man has killed one of the sacred animals, if\\nhe did it with malice prepense, he is punished with death; if unwittingly,\\nhe has to pay such a fine as the priests choose to impose. When an\\nibis, however, or a hawk is killed, whether it was done by accident\\nor on purpose, the man must needs die. \\n\\nThe number of domestic animals in Egypt is very great, and would be\\nstill greater were it not for what befalls the cats. As the females,\\nwhen they have kittened, no longer seek the company of the males,\\nthese last, to obtain once more their companionship, practise a curious\\nartifice. They seize the kittens, carry them off, and kill them, but\\ndo not cat them afterwards. Upon this the females, being deprived\\nof their young, and longing to supply their place, seek the males\\nonce more, since they are particularly fond of their offspring. On\\nevery occasion of a fire in Egypt the strangest prodigy occurs with\\nthe cats. The inhabitants allow the fire to rage as it pleases, while\\nthey stand about at intervals and watch these animals, which, slipping\\nby the men or else leaping over them, rush headlong into the flames.\\nWhen this happens, the Egyptians are in deep affliction. If a cat\\ndies in a private house by a natural death, all the inmates of the\\nhouse shave their eyebrows; on the death of a dog they shave the head\\nand the whole of the body. \\n\\nThe cats on their decease are taken to the city of Bubastis, where\\nthey are embalmed, after which they are buried in certain sacred repositories.\\nThe dogs are interred in the cities to which they belong, also in\\nsacred burial-places. The same practice obtains with respect to the\\nichneumons; the hawks and shrew-mice, on the contrary, are conveyed\\nto the city of Buto for burial, and the ibises to Hermopolis. The\\nbears, which are scarce in Egypt, and the wolves, which are not much\\nbigger than foxes, they bury wherever they happen to find them lying.\\n\\nThe following are the peculiarities of the crocodile:- During the\\nfour winter months they eat nothing; they are four-footed, and live\\nindifferently on land or in the water. The female lays and hatches\\nher eggs ashore, passing the greater portion of the day on dry land,\\nbut at night retiring to the river, the water of which is warmer than\\nthe night-air and the dew. Of all known animals this is the one which\\nfrom the smallest size grows to be the greatest: for the egg of the\\ncrocodile is but little bigger than that of the goose, and the young\\ncrocodile is in proportion to the egg; yet when it is full grown,\\nthe animal measures frequently seventeen cubits and even more. It\\nhas the eyes of a pig, teeth large and tusk-like, of a size proportioned\\nto its frame; unlike any other animal, it is without a tongue; it\\ncannot move its under-jaw, and in this respect too it is singular,\\nbeing the only animal in the world which moves the upper-jaw but not\\nthe under. It has strong claws and a scaly skin, impenetrable upon\\nthe back. In the water it is blind, but on land it is very keen of\\nsight. As it lives chiefly in the river, it has the inside of its\\nmouth constantly covered with leeches; hence it happens that, while\\nall the other birds and beasts avoid it, with the trochilus it lives\\nat peace, since it owes much to that bird: for the crocodile, when\\nhe leaves the water and comes out upon the land, is in the habit of\\nlying with his mouth wide open, facing the western breeze: at such\\ntimes the trochilus goes into his mouth and devours the leeches. This\\nbenefits the crocodile, who is pleased, and takes care not to hurt\\nthe trochilus. \\n\\nThe crocodile is esteemed sacred by some of the Egyptians, by others\\nhe is treated as an enemy. Those who live near Thebes, and those who\\ndwell around Lake Moeris, regard them with especial veneration. In\\neach of these places they keep one crocodile in particular, who is\\ntaught to be tame and tractable. They adorn his ears with ear-rings\\nof molten stone or gold, and put bracelets on his fore-paws, giving\\nhim daily a set portion of bread, with a certain number of victims;\\nand, after having thus treated him with the greatest possible attention\\nwhile alive, they embalm him when he dies and bury him in a sacred\\nrepository. The people of Elephantine on the other hand, are so far\\nfrom considering these animals as sacred that they even eat their\\nflesh. In the Egyptian language they are not called crocodiles, but\\nChampsae. The name of crocodiles was given them by the Ionians, who\\nremarked their resemblance to the lizards, which in Ionia live in\\nthe walls and are called crocodiles. \\n\\nThe modes of catching the crocodile are many and various. I shall\\nonly describe the one which seems to me most worthy of mention. They\\nbait a hook with a chine of pork and let the meat be carried out into\\nthe middle of the stream, while the hunter upon the bank holds a living\\npig, which he belabours. The crocodile hears its cries, and making\\nfor the sound, encounters the pork, which he instantly swallows down.\\nThe men on the shore haul, and when they have got him to land, the\\nfirst thing the hunter does is to plaster his eyes with mud. This\\nonce accomplished, the animal is despatched with ease, otherwise he\\ngives great trouble. \\n\\nThe hippopotamus, in the canton of Papremis, is a sacred animal, but\\nnot in any other part of Egypt. It may be thus described:- It is a\\nquadruped, cloven-footed, with hoofs like an ox, and a flat nose.\\nIt has the mane and tail of a horse, huge tusks which are very conspicuous,\\nand a voice like a horse\\'s neigh. In size it equals the biggest oxen,\\nand its skin is so tough that when dried it is made into javelins.\\n\\nOtters also are found in the Nile, and are considered sacred. Only\\ntwo sorts of fish are venerated, that called the lepidotus and the\\neel. These are regarded as sacred to the Nile, as likewise among birds\\nis the vulpanser, or fox-goose. \\n\\nThey have also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I myself\\nhave never seen, except in pictures. Indeed it is a great rarity,\\neven in Egypt, only coming there (according to the accounts of the\\npeople of Heliopolis) once in five hundred years, when the old phoenix\\ndies. Its size and appearance, if it is like the pictures, are as\\nfollow:- The plumage is partly red, partly golden, while the general\\nmake and size are almost exactly that of the eagle. They tell a story\\nof what this bird does, which does not seem to me to be credible:\\nthat he comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird,\\nall plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the Sun, and there\\nburies the body. In order to bring him, they say, he first forms a\\nball of myrrh as big as he finds that he can carry; then he hollows\\nout the ball, and puts his parent inside, after which he covers over\\nthe opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball is then of exactly the\\nsame weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt, plastered over\\nas I have said, and deposits it in the temple of the Sun. Such is\\nthe story they tell of the doings of this bird. \\n\\nIn the neighbourhood of Thebes there are some sacred serpents which\\nare perfectly harmless. They are of small size, and have two horns\\ngrowing out of the top of the head. These snakes, when they die, are\\nburied in the temple of Jupiter, the god to whom they are sacred.\\n\\nI went once to a certain place in Arabia, almost exactly opposite\\nthe city of Buto, to make inquiries concerning the winged serpents.\\nOn my arrival I saw the back-bones and ribs of serpents in such numbers\\nas it is impossible to describe: of the ribs there were a multitude\\nof heaps, some great, some small, some middle-sized. The place where\\nthe bones lie is at the entrance of a narrow gorge between steep mountains,\\nwhich there open upon a spacious plain communicating with the great\\nplain of Egypt. The story goes that with the spring the winged snakes\\ncome flying from Arabia towards Egypt, but are met in this gorge by\\nthe birds called ibises, who forbid their entrance and destroy them\\nall. The Arabians assert, and the Egyptians also admit, that it is\\non account of the service thus rendered that the Egyptians hold the\\nibis in so much reverence. \\n\\nThe ibis is a bird of a deep-black colour, with legs like a crane;\\nits beak is strongly hooked, and its size is about that of the land-rail.\\nThis is a description of the black ibis which contends with the serpents.\\nThe commoner sort, for there are two quite distinct species, has the\\nhead and the whole throat bare of feathers; its general plumage is\\nwhite, but the head and neck are jet black, as also are the tips of\\nthe wings and the extremity of the tail; in its beak and legs it resembles\\nthe other species. The winged serpent is shaped like the water-snake.\\nIts wings are not feathered, but resemble very closely those of the\\nbat. And thus I conclude the subject of the sacred animals.\\n\\nWith respect to the Egyptians themselves, it is to be remarked that\\nthose who live in the corn country, devoting themselves, as they do,\\nfar more than any other people in the world, to the preservation of\\nthe memory of past actions, are the best skilled in history of any\\nmen that I have ever met. The following is the mode of life habitual\\nto them:- For three successive days in each month they purge the body\\nby means of emetics and clysters, which is done out of a regard for\\ntheir health, since they have a persuasion that every disease to which\\nmen are liable is occasioned by the substances whereon they feed.\\nApart from any such precautions, they are, I believe, next to the\\nLibyans, the healthiest people in the world- an effect of their climate,\\nin my opinion, which has no sudden changes. Diseases almost always\\nattack men when they are exposed to a change, and never more than\\nduring changes of the weather. They live on bread made of spelt, which\\nthey form into loaves called in their own tongue cyllestis. Their\\ndrink is a wine which they obtain from barley, as they have no vines\\nin their country. Many kinds of fish they eat raw, either salted or\\ndried in the sun. Quails also, and ducks and small birds, they eat\\nuncooked, merely first salting them. All other birds and fishes, excepting\\nthose which are set apart as sacred, are eaten either roasted or boiled.\\n\\nIn social meetings among the rich, when the banquet is ended, a servant\\ncarries round to the several guests a coffin, in which there is a\\nwooden image of a corpse, carved and painted to resemble nature as\\nnearly as possible, about a cubit or two cubits in length. As he shows\\nit to each guest in turn, the servant says, \"Gaze here, and drink\\nand be merry; for when you die, such will you be.\" \\n\\nThe Egyptians adhere to their own national customs, and adopt no foreign\\nusages. Many of these customs are worthy of note: among others their\\nsong, the Linus, which is sung under various names not only in Egypt\\nbut in Phoenicia, in Cyprus, and in other places; and which seems\\nto be exactly the same as that in use among the Greeks, and by them\\ncalled Linus. There were very many things in Egypt which filled me\\nwith astonishment, and this was one of them. Whence could the Egyptians\\nhave got the Linus? It appears to have been sung by them from the\\nvery earliest times. For the Linus in Egyptian is called Maneros;\\nand they told me that Maneros was the only son of their first king,\\nand that on his untimely death he was honoured by the Egyptians with\\nthese dirgelike strains, and in this way they got their first and\\nonly melody. \\n\\nThere is another custom in which the Egyptians resemble a particular\\nGreek people, namely the Lacedaemonians. Their young men, when they\\nmeet their elders in the streets, give way to them and step aside;\\nand if an elder come in where young men are present, these latter\\nrise from their seats. In a third point they differ entirely from\\nall the nations of Greece. Instead of speaking to each other when\\nthey meet in the streets, they make an obeisance, sinking the hand\\nto the knee. \\n\\nThey wear a linen tunic fringed about the legs, and called calasiris;\\nover this they have a white woollen garment thrown on afterwards.\\nNothing of woollen, however, is taken into their temples or buried\\nwith them, as their religion forbids it. Here their practice resembles\\nthe rites called Orphic and Bacchic, but which are in reality Egyptian\\nand Pythagorean; for no one initiated in these mysteries can be buried\\nin a woollen shroud, a religious reason being assigned for the observance.\\n\\nThe Egyptians likewise discovered to which of the gods each month\\nand day is sacred; and found out from the day of a man\\'s birth what\\nhe will meet with in the course of his life, and how he will end his\\ndays, and what sort of man he will be- discoveries whereof the Greeks\\nengaged in poetry have made a use. The Egyptians have also discovered\\nmore prognostics than all the rest of mankind besides. Whenever a\\nprodigy takes place, they watch and record the result; then, if anything\\nsimilar ever happens again, they expect the same consequences.\\n\\nWith respect to divination, they hold that it is a gift which no mortal\\npossesses, but only certain of the gods: thus they have an oracle\\nof Hercules, one of Apollo, of Minerva, of Diana, of Mars, and of\\nJupiter. Besides these, there is the oracle of Latona at Buto, which\\nis held in much higher repute than any of the rest. The mode of delivering\\nthe oracles is not uniform, but varies at the different shrines.\\n\\nMedicine is practised among them on a plan of separation; each physician\\ntreats a single disorder, and no more: thus the country swarms with\\nmedical practitioners, some undertaking to cure diseases of the eye,\\nothers of the head, others again of the teeth, others of the intestines,\\nand some those which are not local. \\n\\nThe following is the way in which they conduct their mournings and\\ntheir funerals:- On the death in any house of a man of consequence,\\nforthwith the women of the family beplaster their heads, and sometimes\\neven their faces, with mud; and then, leaving the body indoors, sally\\nforth and wander through the city, with their dress fastened by a\\nband, and their bosoms bare, beating themselves as they walk. All\\nthe female relations join them and do the same. The men too, similarly\\nbegirt, beat their breasts separately. When these ceremonies are over,\\nthe body is carried away to be embalmed. \\n\\nThere are a set of men in Egypt who practice the art of embalming,\\nand make it their proper business. These persons, when a body is brought\\nto them, show the bearers various models of corpses, made in wood,\\nand painted so as to resemble nature. The most perfect is said to\\nbe after the manner of him whom I do not think it religious to name\\nin connection with such a matter; the second sort is inferior to the\\nfirst, and less costly; the third is the cheapest of all. All this\\nthe embalmers explain, and then ask in which way it is wished that\\nthe corpse should be prepared. The bearers tell them, and having concluded\\ntheir bargain, take their departure, while the embalmers, left to\\nthemselves, proceed to their task. The mode of embalming, according\\nto the most perfect process, is the following:- They take first a\\ncrooked piece of iron, and with it draw out the brain through the\\nnostrils, thus getting rid of a portion, while the skull is cleared\\nof the rest by rinsing with drugs; next they make a cut along the\\nflank with a sharp Ethiopian stone, and take out the whole contents\\nof the abdomen, which they then cleanse, washing it thoroughly with\\npalm wine, and again frequently with an infusion of pounded aromatics.\\nAfter this they fill the cavity with the purest bruised myrrh, with\\ncassia, and every other sort of spicery except frankincense, and sew\\nup the opening. Then the body is placed in natrum for seventy days,\\nand covered entirely over. After the expiration of that space of time,\\nwhich must not be exceeded, the body is washed, and wrapped round,\\nfrom head to foot, with bandages of fine linen cloth, smeared over\\nwith gum, which is used generally by the Egyptians in the place of\\nglue, and in this state it is given back to the relations, who enclose\\nit in a wooden case which they have had made for the purpose, shaped\\ninto the figure of a man. Then fastening the case, they place it in\\na sepulchral chamber, upright against the wall. Such is the most costly\\nway of embalming the dead. \\n\\nIf persons wish to avoid expense, and choose the second process, the\\nfollowing is the method pursued:- Syringes are filled with oil made\\nfrom the cedar-tree, which is then, without any incision or disembowelling,\\ninjected into the abdomen. The passage by which it might be likely\\nto return is stopped, and the body laid in natrum the prescribed number\\nof days. At the end of the time the cedar-oil is allowed to make its\\nescape; and such is its power that it brings with it the whole stomach\\nand intestines in a liquid state. The natrum meanwhile has dissolved\\nthe flesh, and so nothing is left of the dead body but the skin and\\nthe bones. It is returned in this condition to the relatives, without\\nany further trouble being bestowed upon it. \\n\\nThe third method of embalming, which is practised in the case of the\\npoorer classes, is to clear out the intestines with a clyster, and\\nlet the body lie in natrum the seventy days, after which it is at\\nonce given to those who come to fetch it away. \\n\\nThe wives of men of rank are not given to be embalmed immediately\\nafter death, nor indeed are any of the more beautiful and valued women.\\nIt is not till they have been dead three or four days that they are\\ncarried to the embalmers. This is done to prevent indignities from\\nbeing offered them. It is said that once a case of this kind occurred:\\nthe man was detected by the information of his fellow-workman.\\n\\nWhensoever any one, Egyptian or foreigner, has lost his life by falling\\na prey to a crocodile, or by drowning in the river, the law compels\\nthe inhabitants of the city near which the body is cast up to have\\nit embalmed, and to bury it in one of the sacred repositories with\\nall possible magnificence. No one may touch the corpse, not even any\\nof the friends or relatives, but only the priests of the Nile, who\\nprepare it for burial with their own hands- regarding it as something\\nmore than the mere body of a man- and themselves lay it in the tomb.\\n\\nThe Egyptians are averse to adopt Greek customs, or, in a word, those\\nof any other nation. This feeling is almost universal among them.\\nAt Chemmis, however, which is a large city in the Thebaic canton,\\nnear Neapolis, there is a square enclosure sacred to Perseus, son\\nof Danae. Palm trees grow all round the place, which has a stone gateway\\nof an unusual size, surmounted by two colossal statues, also in stone.\\nInside this precinct is a temple, and in the temple an image of Perseus.\\nThe people of Chemmis say that Perseus often appears to them, sometimes\\nwithin the sacred enclosure, sometimes in the open country: one of\\nthe sandals which he has worn is frequently found- two cubits in length,\\nas they affirm- and then all Egypt flourishes greatly. In the worship\\nof Perseus Greek ceremonies are used; gymnastic games are celebrated\\nin his honour, comprising every kind of contest, with prizes of cattle,\\ncloaks, and skins. I made inquiries of the Chemmites why it was that\\nPerseus appeared to them and not elsewhere in Egypt, and how they\\ncame to celebrate gymnastic contests unlike the rest of the Egyptians:\\nto which they answered, \"that Perseus belonged to their city by descent.\\nDanans and Lynceus were Chemmites before they set sail for Greece,\\nand from them Perseus was descended,\" they said, tracing the genealogy;\\n\"and he, when he came to Egypt for the purpose\" (which the Greeks\\nalso assign) \"of bringing away from Libya the Gorgon\\'s head, paid\\nthem a visit, and acknowledged them for his kinsmen- he had heard\\nthe name of their city from his mother before he left Greece- he bade\\nthem institute a gymnastic contest in his honour, and that was the\\nreason why they observed the practice.\" \\n\\nThe customs hitherto described are those of the Egyptians who live\\nabove the marsh-country. The inhabitants of the marshes have the same\\ncustoms as the rest, as well in those matters which have been mentioned\\nabove as in respect of marriage, each Egyptian taking to himself,\\nlike the Greeks, a single wife; but for greater cheapness of living\\nthe marsh-men practise certain peculiar customs, such as these following.\\nThey gather the blossoms of a certain water-lily, which grows in great\\nabundance all over the flat country at the time when the Nile rises\\nand floods the regions along its banks- the Egyptians call it lotus-\\nthey gather, I say, the blossoms of this plant and dry them in the\\nsun, after which they extract from the centre of each blossom a substance\\nlike the head of a poppy, which they crush and make into bread. The\\nroot of the lotus is likewise eatable, and has a pleasant sweet taste:\\nit is round, and about the size of an apple. There is also another\\nspecies of the lily in Egypt, which grows, like the lotus, in the\\nriver, and resembles the rose. The fruit springs up side by side with\\nthe blossom, on a separate stalk, and has almost exactly the look\\nof the comb made by wasps. It contains a number of seeds, about the\\nsize of an olive-stone, which are good to eat: and these are eaten\\nboth green and dried. The byblus (papyrus), which grows year after\\nyear in the marshes, they pull up, and, cutting the plant in two,\\nreserve the upper portion for other purposes, but take the lower,\\nwhich is about a cubit long, and either eat it or else sell it. Such\\nas wish to enjoy the byblus in full perfection bake it first in a\\nclosed vessel, heated to a glow. Some of these folk, however, live\\nentirely on fish, which are gutted as soon as caught, and then hung\\nup in the sun: when dry, they are used as food. \\n\\nGregarious fish are not found in any numbers in the rivers; they frequent\\nthe lagunes, whence, at the season of breeding, they proceed in shoals\\ntowards the sea. The males lead the way, and drop their milt as they\\ngo, while the females, following close behind, eagerly swallow it\\ndown. From this they conceive, and when, after passing some time in\\nthe sea, they begin to be in spawn, the whole shoal sets off on its\\nreturn to its ancient haunts. Now, however, it is no longer the males,\\nbut the females, who take the lead: they swim in front in a body,\\nand do exactly as the males did before, dropping, little by little,\\ntheir grains of spawn as they go, while the males in the rear devour\\nthe grains, each one of which is a fish. A portion of the spawn escapes\\nand is not swallowed by the males, and hence come the fishes which\\ngrow afterwards to maturity. Whan any of this sort of fish are taken\\non their passage to the sea, they are found to have the left side\\nof the head scarred and bruised; while if taken on their return, the\\nmarks appear on the right. The reason is that as they swim down the\\nNile seaward, they keep close to the bank of the river upon their\\nleft, and returning again up stream they still cling to the same side,\\nhugging it and brushing against it constantly, to be sure that they\\nmiss not their road through the great force of the current. When the\\nNile begins to rise, the hollows in the land and the marshy spots\\nnear the river are flooded before any other places by the percolation\\nof the water through the riverbanks; and these, almost as soon as\\nthey become pools, are found to be full of numbers of little fishes.\\nI think that I understand how it is this comes to pass. On the subsidence\\nof the Nile the year before, though the fish retired with the retreating\\nwaters, they had first deposited their spawn in the mud upon the banks;\\nand so, when at the usual season the water returns, small fry are\\nrapidly engendered out of the spawn of the preceding year. So much\\nconcerning the fish. \\n\\nThe Egyptians who live in the marshes use for the anointing of their\\nbodies an oil made from the fruit of the sillicyprium, which is known\\namong them by the name of \"kiki.\" To obtain this they plant the sillicyprium\\n(which grows wild in Greece) along the banks of the rivers and by\\nthe sides of the lakes, where it produces fruit in great abundance,\\nbut with a very disagreeable smell. This fruit is gathered, and then\\nbruised and pressed, or else boiled down after roasting: the liquid\\nwhich comes from it is collected and is found to be unctuous, and\\nas well suited as olive-oil for lamps, only that it gives out an unpleasant\\nodour. \\n\\nThe contrivances which they use against gnats, wherewith the country\\nswarms, are the following. In the parts of Egypt above the marshes\\nthe inhabitants pass the night upon lofty towers, which are of great\\nservice, as the gnats are unable to fly to any height on account of\\nthe winds. In the marsh-country, where there are no towers, each man\\npossesses a net instead. By day it serves him to catch fish, while\\nat night he spreads it over the bed in which he is to rest, and creeping\\nin, goes to sleep underneath. The gnats, which, if he rolls himself\\nup in his dress or in a piece of muslin, are sure to bite through\\nthe covering, do not so much as attempt to pass the net.\\n\\nThe vessels used in Egypt for the transport of merchandise are made\\nof the Acantha (Thorn), a tree which in its growth is very like the\\nCyrenaic lotus, and from which there exudes a gum. They cut a quantity\\nof planks about two cubits in length from this tree, and then proceed\\nto their ship-building, arranging the planks like bricks, and attaching\\nthem by ties to a number of long stakes or poles till the hull is\\ncomplete, when they lay the cross-planks on the top from side to side.\\nThey give the boats no ribs, but caulk the seams with papyrus on the\\ninside. Each has a single rudder, which is driven straight through\\nthe keel. The mast is a piece of acantha-wood, and the sails are made\\nof papyrus. These boats cannot make way against the current unless\\nthere is a brisk breeze; they are, therefore, towed up-stream from\\nthe shore: down-stream they are managed as follows. There is a raft\\nbelonging to each, made of the wood of the tamarisk, fastened together\\nwith a wattling of reeds; and also a stone bored through the middle\\nabout two talents in weight. The raft is fastened to the vessel by\\na rope, and allowed to float down the stream in front, while the stone\\nis attached by another rope astern. The result is that the raft, hurried\\nforward by the current, goes rapidly down the river, and drags the\\n\"baris\" (for so they call this sort of boat) after it; while the stone,\\nwhich is pulled along in the wake of the vessel, and lies deep in\\nthe water, keeps the boat straight. There are a vast number of these\\nvessels in Egypt, and some of them are of many thousand talents\\' burthen.\\n\\nWhen the Nile overflows, the country is converted into a sea, and\\nnothing appears but the cities, which look like the islands in the\\nEgean. At this season boats no longer keep the course of the river,\\nbut sail right across the plain. On the voyage from Naucratis to Memphis\\nat this season, you pass close to the pyramids, whereas the usual\\ncourse is by the apex of the Delta, and the city of Cercasorus. You\\ncan sail also from the maritime town of Canobus across the flat to\\nNaucratis, passing by the cities of Anthylla and Archandropolis.\\n\\nThe former of these cities, which is a place of note, is assigned\\nexpressly to the wife of the ruler of Egypt for the time being, to\\nkeep her in shoes. Such has been the custom ever since Egypt fell\\nunder the Persian yoke. The other city seems to me to have got its\\nname of Archandropolis from Archander the Phthian, son of Achaeus,\\nand son-in-law of Danaus. There might certainly have been another\\nArchander; but, at any rate, the name is not Egyptian. \\n\\nThus far I have spoken of Egypt from my own observation, relating\\nwhat I myself saw, the ideas that I formed, and the results of my\\nown researches. What follows rests on the accounts given me by the\\nEgyptians, which shall now repeat, adding thereto some particulars\\nwhich fell under by own notice. \\n\\nThe priests said that Min was the first king of Egypt, and that it\\nwas he who raised the dyke which protects Memphis from the inundations\\nof the Nile. Before his time the river flowed entirely along the sandy\\nrange of hills which skirts Egypt on the side of Libya. He, however,\\nby banking up the river at the bend which it forms about a hundred\\nfurlongs south of Memphis, laid the ancient channel dry, while he\\ndug a new course for the stream halfway between the two lines of hills.\\nTo this day, the elbow which the Nile forms at the point where it\\nis forced aside into the new channel is guarded with the greatest\\ncare by the Persians, and strengthened every year; for if the river\\nwere to burst out at this place, and pour over the mound, there would\\nbe danger of Memphis being completely overwhelmed by the flood. Min,\\nthe first king, having thus, by turning the river, made the tract\\nwhere it used to run, dry land, proceeded in the first place to build\\nthe city now called Memphis, which lies in the narrow part of Egypt;\\nafter which he further excavated a lake outside the town, to the north\\nand west, communicating with the river, which was itself the eastern\\nboundary. Besides these works, he also, the priests said, built the\\ntemple of Vulcan which stands within the city, a vast edifice, very\\nworthy of mention. \\n\\nNext, they read me from a papyrus the names of three hundred and thirty\\nmonarchs, who (they said) were his successors upon the throne. In\\nthis number of generations there were eighteen Ethiopian kings, and\\none queen who was a native; all the rest were kings and Egyptians.\\nThe queen bore the same name as the Babylonian princess, namely, Nitocris.\\nThey said that she succeeded her brother; he had been king of Egypt,\\nand was put to death by his subjects, who then placed her upon the\\nthrone. Bent on avenging his death, she devised a cunning scheme by\\nwhich she destroyed a vast number of Egyptians. She constructed a\\nspacious underground chamber, and, on pretence of inaugurating it,\\ncontrived the following:- Inviting to a banquet those of the Egyptians\\nwhom she knew to have had the chief share in the murder of her brother,\\nshe suddenly, as they were feasting, let the river in upon them by\\nmeans of a secret duct of large size. This and this only did they\\ntell me of her, except that, when she had done as I have said, she\\nthrew herself into an apartment full of ashes, that she might escape\\nthe vengeance whereto she would otherwise have been exposed.\\n\\nThe other kings, they said, were personages of no note or distinction,\\nand left no monuments of any account, with the exception of the last,\\nwho was named Moeris. He left several memorials of his reign- the\\nnorthern gateway of the temple of Vulcan, the lake excavated by his\\norders, whose dimensions I shall give presently, and the pyramids\\nbuilt by him in the lake, the size of which will be stated when I\\ndescribe the lake itself wherein they stand. Such were his works:\\nthe other kings left absolutely nothing. \\n\\nPassing over these monarchs, therefore, I shall speak of the king\\nwho reigned next, whose name was Sesostris. He, the priests said,\\nfirst of all proceeded in a fleet of ships of war from the Arabian\\ngulf along the shores of the Erythraean sea, subduing the nations\\nas he went, until he finally reached a sea which could not be navigated\\nby reason of the shoals. Hence he returned to Egypt, where, they told\\nme, he collected a vast armament, and made a progress by land across\\nthe continent, conquering every people which fell in his way. In the\\ncountries where the natives withstood his attack, and fought gallantly\\nfor their liberties, he erected pillars, on which he inscribed his\\nown name and country, and how that he had here reduced the inhabitants\\nto subjection by the might of his arms: where, on the contrary, they\\nsubmitted readily and without a struggle, he inscribed on the pillars,\\nin addition to these particulars, an emblem to mark that they were\\na nation of women, that is, unwarlike and effeminate. \\n\\nIn this way he traversed the whole continent of Asia, whence he passed\\non into Europe, and made himself master of Scythia and of Thrace,\\nbeyond which countries I do not think that his army extended its march.\\nFor thus far the pillars which he erected are still visible, but in\\nthe remoter regions they are no longer found. Returning to Egypt from\\nThrace, he came, on his way, to the banks of the river Phasis. Here\\nI cannot say with any certainty what took place. Either he of his\\nown accord detached a body of troops from his main army and left them\\nto colonise the country, or else a certain number of his soldiers,\\nwearied with their long wanderings, deserted, and established themselves\\non the banks of this stream. \\n\\nThere can be no doubt that the Colchians are an Egyptian race. Before\\nI heard any mention of the fact from others, I had remarked it myself.\\nAfter the thought had struck me, I made inquiries on the subject both\\nin Colchis and in Egypt, and I found that the Colchians had a more\\ndistinct recollection of the Egyptians, than the Egyptians had of\\nthem. Still the Egyptians said that they believed the Colchians to\\nbe descended from the army of Sesostris. My own conjectures were founded,\\nfirst, on the fact that they are black-skinned and have woolly hair,\\nwhich certainly amounts to but little, since several other nations\\nare so too; but further and more especially, on the circumstance that\\nthe Colchians, the Egyptians, and the Ethiopians, are the only nations\\nwho have practised circumcision from the earliest times. The Phoenicians\\nand the Syrians of Palestine themselves confess that they learnt the\\ncustom of the Egyptians; and the Syrians who dwell about the rivers\\nThermodon and Parthenius, as well as their neighbours the Macronians,\\nsay that they have recently adopted it from the Colchians. Now these\\nare the only nations who use circumcision, and it is plain that they\\nall imitate herein the Egyptians. With respect to the Ethiopians,\\nindeed, I cannot decide whether they learnt the practice of the Egyptians,\\nor the Egyptians of them- it is undoubtedly of very ancient date in\\nEthiopia- but that the others derived their knowledge of it from Egypt\\nis clear to me from the fact that the Phoenicians, when they come\\nto have commerce with the Greeks, cease to follow the Egyptians in\\nthis custom, and allow their children to remain uncircumcised.\\n\\nI will add a further proof to the identity of the Egyptians and the\\nColchians. These two nations weave their linen in exactly the same\\nway, and this is a way entirely unknown to the rest of the world;\\nthey also in their whole mode of life and in their language resemble\\none another. The Colchian linen is called by the Greeks Sardinian,\\nwhile that which comes from Egypt is known as Egyptian. \\n\\nThe pillars which Sesostris erected in the conquered countries have\\nfor the most part disappeared; but in the part of Syria called Palestine,\\nI myself saw them still standing, with the writing above-mentioned,\\nand the emblem distinctly visible. In Ionia also, there are two representations\\nof this prince engraved upon rocks, one on the road from Ephesus to\\nPhocaea, the other between Sardis and Smyrna. In each case the figure\\nis that of a man, four cubits and a span high, with a spear in his\\nright hand and a bow in his left, the rest of his costume being likewise\\nhalf Egyptian, half Ethiopian. There is an inscription across the\\nbreast from shoulder to shoulder, in the sacred character of Egypt,\\nwhich says, \"With my own shoulders I conquered this land.\" The conqueror\\ndoes not tell who he is, or whence he comes, though elsewhere Sesostris\\nrecords these facts. Hence it has been imagined by some of those who\\nhave seen these forms, that they are figures of Memnon; but such as\\nthink so err very widely from the truth. \\n\\nThis Sesostris, the priests went on to say, upon his return home,\\naccompanied by vast multitudes of the people whose countries he had\\nsubdued, was received by his brother, whom he had made viceroy of\\nEgypt on his departure, at Daphnae near Pelusium, and invited by him\\nto a banquet, which he attended, together with his sons. Then his\\nbrother piled a quantity of wood all round the building, and having\\nso done set it alight. Sesostris, discovering what had happened, took\\ncounsel instantly with his wife, who had accompanied him to the feast,\\nand was advised by her to lay two of their six sons upon the fire,\\nand so make a bridge across the flames, whereby the rest might effect\\ntheir escape. Sesostris did as she recommended, and thus while two\\nof his sons were burnt to death, he himself and his other children\\nwere saved. \\n\\nThe king then returned to his own land and took vengeance upon his\\nbrother, after which he proceeded to make use of the multitudes whom\\nhe had brought with him from the conquered countries, partly to drag\\nthe huge masses of stone which were moved in the course of his reign\\nto the temple of Vulcan- partly to dig the numerous canals with which\\nthe whole of Egypt is intersected. By these forced labours the entire\\nface of the country was changed; for whereas Egypt had formerly been\\na region suited both for horses and carriages, henceforth it became\\nentirely unfit for either. Though a flat country throughout its whole\\nextent, it is now unfit for either horse or carriage, being cut up\\nby the canals, which are extremely numerous and run in all directions.\\nThe king\\'s object was to supply Nile water to the inhabitants of the\\ntowns situated in the mid-country, and not lying upon the river; for\\npreviously they had been obliged, after the subsidence of the floods,\\nto drink a brackish water which they obtained from wells.\\n\\nSesostris also, they declared, made a division of the soil of Egypt\\namong the inhabitants, assigning square plots of ground of equal size\\nto all, and obtaining his chief revenue from the rent which the holders\\nwere required to pay him year by year. If the river carried away any\\nportion of a man\\'s lot, he appeared before the king, and related what\\nhad happened; upon which the king sent persons to examine, and determine\\nby measurement the exact extent of the loss; and thenceforth only\\nsuch a rent was demanded of him as was proportionate to the reduced\\nsize of his land. From this practice, I think, geometry first came\\nto be known in Egypt, whence it passed into Greece. The sun-dial,\\nhowever, and the gnomon with the division of the day into twelve parts,\\nwere received by the Greeks from the Babylonians. \\n\\nSesostris was king not only of Egypt, but also of Ethiopia. He was\\nthe only Egyptian monarch who ever ruled over the latter country.\\nHe left, as memorials of his reign, the stone statues which stand\\nin front of the temple of Vulcan, two of which, representing himself\\nand his wife, are thirty cubits in height, while the remaining four,\\nwhich represent his sons, are twenty cubits. These are the statues,\\nin front of which the priest of Vulcan, very many years afterwards,\\nwould not allow Darius the Persian to place a statue of himself; \"because,\"\\nhe said, \"Darius had not equalled the achievements of Sesostris the\\nEgyptian: for while Sesostris had subdued to the full as many nations\\nas ever Darius had brought under, he had likewise conquered the Scythians,\\nwhom Darius had failed to master. It was not fair, therefore, that\\nhe should erect his statue in front of the offerings of a king, whose\\ndeeds he had been unable to surpass.\" Darius, they say, pardoned the\\nfreedom of this speech. \\n\\nOn the death of Sesostris, his son Pheron, the priests said, mounted\\nthe throne. He undertook no warlike expeditions; being struck with\\nblindness, owing to the following circumstance. The river had swollen\\nto the unusual height of eighteen cubits, and had overflowed all the\\nfields, when, a sudden wind arising, the water rose in great waves.\\nThen the king, in a spirit of impious violence, seized his spear,\\nand hurled it into the strong eddies of the stream. Instantly he was\\nsmitten with disease of the eyes, from which after a little while\\nhe became blind, continuing without the power of vision for ten years.\\nAt last, in the eleventh year, an oracular announcement reached him\\nfrom the city of Buto, to the effect, that \"the time of his punishment\\nhad run out, and he should recover his sight by washing his eyes with\\nurine. He must find a woman who had been faithful to her husband,\\nand had never preferred to him another man.\" The king, therefore,\\nfirst of all made trial of his wife, but to no purpose he continued\\nas blind as before. So he made the experiment with other women, until\\nat length he succeeded, and in this way recovered his sight. Hereupon\\nhe assembled all the women, except the last, and bringing them to\\nthe city which now bears the name of Erythrabolus (Red-soil), he there\\nburnt them all, together with the place itself. The woman to whom\\nhe owed his cure, he married, and after his recovery was complete,\\nhe presented offerings to all the temples of any note, among which\\nthe best worthy of mention are the two stone obelisks which he gave\\nto the temple of the Sun. These are magnificent works; each is made\\nof a single stone, eight cubits broad, and a hundred cubits in height.\\n\\nPheron, they said, was succeeded by a man of Memphis, whose name,\\nin the language of the Greeks, was Proteus. There is a sacred precinct\\nof this king in Memphis, which is very beautiful, and richly adorned,\\nsituated south of the great temple of Vulcan. Phoenicians from the\\ncity of Tyre dwell all round this precinct, and the whole place is\\nknown by the name of \"the camp of the Tyrians.\" Within the enclosure\\nstands a temple, which is called that of Venus the Stranger. I conjecture\\nthe building to have been erected to Helen, the daughter of Tyndarus;\\nfirst, because she, as I have heard say, passed some time at the court\\nof Proteus; and secondly, because the temple is dedicated to Venus\\nthe Stranger; for among all the many temples of Venus there is no\\nother where the goddess bears this title. \\n\\nThe priests, in answer to my inquiries on the subject of Helen, informed\\nme of the following particulars. When Alexander had carried off Helen\\nfrom Sparta, he took ship and sailed homewards. On his way across\\nthe Egean a gale arose, which drove him from his course and took him\\ndown to the sea of Egypt; hence, as the wind did not abate, he was\\ncarried on to the coast, when he went ashore, landing at the Salt-Pans,\\nin that mouth of the Nile which is now called the Canobic. At this\\nplace there stood upon the shore a temple, which still exists, dedicated\\nto Hercules. If a slave runs away from his master, and taking sanctuary\\nat this shrine gives himself up to the god, and receives certain sacred\\nmarks upon his person, whosoever his master may be, he cannot lay\\nhand on him. This law still remained unchanged to my time. Hearing,\\ntherefore, of the custom of the place, the attendants of Alexander\\ndeserted him, and fled to the temple, where they sat as suppliants.\\nWhile there, wishing to damage their master, they accused him to the\\nEgyptians, narrating all the circumstances of the rape of Helen and\\nthe wrong done to Menelaus. These charges they brought, not only before\\nthe priests, but also before the warden of that mouth of the river,\\nwhose name was Thonis. \\n\\nAs soon as he received the intelligence, Thonis sent a message to\\nProteus, who was at Memphis, to this effect: \"A stranger is arrived\\nfrom Greece; he is by race a Teucrian, and has done a wicked deed\\nin the country from which he is come. Having beguiled the wife of\\nthe man whose guest he was, he carried her away with him, and much\\ntreasure also. Compelled by stress of weather, he has now put in here.\\nAre we to let him depart as he came, or shall we seize what he has\\nbrought?\" Proteus replied, \"Seize the man, be he who he may, that\\nhas dealt thus wickedly with his friend, and bring him before me,\\nthat I may hear what he will say for himself.\" \\n\\nThonis, on receiving these orders, arrested Alexander, and stopped\\nthe departure of his ships; then, taking with him Alexander, Helen,\\nthe treasures, and also the fugitive slaves, he went up to Memphis.\\nWhen all were arrived, Proteus asked Alexander, \"who he was, and whence\\nhe had come?\" Alexander replied by giving his descent, the name of\\nhis country, and a true account of his late voyage. Then Proteus questioned\\nhim as to how he got possession of Helen. In his reply Alexander became\\nconfused, and diverged from the truth, whereon the slaves interposed,\\nconfuted his statements, and told the whole history of the crime.\\nFinally, Proteus delivered judgment as follows: \"Did I not regard\\nit as a matter of the utmost consequence that no stranger driven to\\nmy country by adverse winds should ever be put to death, I would certainly\\nhave avenged the Greek by slaying thee. Thou basest of men,- after\\naccepting hospitality, to do so wicked a deed! First, thou didst seduce\\nthe wife of thy own host- then, not content therewith, thou must violently\\nexcite her mind, and steal her away from her husband. Nay, even so\\nthou wert not satisfied, but on leaving, thou must plunder the house\\nin which thou hadst been a guest. Now then, as I think it of the greatest\\nimportance to put no stranger to death, I suffer thee to depart; but\\nthe woman and the treasures I shall not permit to be carried away.\\nHere they must stay, till the Greek stranger comes in person and takes\\nthem back with him. For thyself and thy companions, I command thee\\nto begone from my land within the space of three days- and I warn\\nyou, that otherwise at the end of that time you will be treated as\\nenemies.\" \\n\\nSuch was the tale told me by the priests concerning the arrival of\\nHelen at the court of Proteus. It seems to me that Homer was acquainted\\nwith this story, and while discarding it, because he thought it less\\nadapted for epic poetry than the version which he followed, showed\\nthat it was not unknown to him. This is evident from the travels which\\nhe assigns to Alexander in the Iliad- and let it be borne in mind\\nthat he has nowhere else contradicted himself- making him be carried\\nout of his course on his return with Helen, and after divers wanderings\\ncome at last to Sidon in Phoenicia. The passage is in the Bravery\\nof Diomed, and the words are as follows:- \\n\\nThere were the robes, many-coloured, the work of Sidonian women:\\n\\nThey from Sidon had come, what time god-shaped Alexander\\n\\nOver the broad sea brought, that way, the high-born Helen.\\n\\nIn the Odyssey also the same fact is alluded to, in these words:-\\n\\nSuch, so wisely prepared, were the drugs that her stores afforded,\\n\\nExcellent; gift which once Polydamna, partner of Thonis,\\n\\nGave her in Egypt, where many the simples that grow in the meadows,\\n\\nPotent to cure in part, in part as potent to injure. \\n\\nMenelaus too, in the same poem, thus addresses Telemachus:-\\n\\nMuch did I long to return, but the Gods still kept me in Egypt-\\n\\nAngry because I had failed to pay them their hecatombs duly.\\n\\nIn these places Homer shows himself acquainted with the voyage of\\nAlexander to Egypt, for Syria borders on Egypt, and the Phoenicians,\\nto whom Sidon belongs, dwell in Syria. \\n\\nFrom these various passages, and from that about Sidon especially,\\nit is clear that Homer did not write the Cypria. For there it is said\\nthat Alexander arrived at Ilium with Helen on the third day after\\nhe left Sparta, the wind having been favourable, and the sea smooth;\\nwhereas in the Iliad, the poet makes him wander before he brings her\\nhome. Enough, however, for the present of Homer and the Cypria.\\n\\nI made inquiry of the priests whether the story which the Greeks tell\\nabout Ilium is a fable, or no. In reply they related the following\\nparticulars, of which they declared that Menelaus had himself informed\\nthem. After the rape of Helen, a vast army of Greeks, wishing to render\\nhelp to Menelaus, set sail for the Teucrian territory; on their arrival\\nthey disembarked, and formed their camp, after which they sent ambassadors\\nto Ilium, of whom Menelaus was one. The embassy was received within\\nthe walls, and demanded the restoration of Helen with the treasures\\nwhich Alexander had carried off, and likewise required satisfaction\\nfor the wrong done. The Teucrians gave at once the answer in which\\nthey persisted ever afterwards, backing their assertions sometimes\\neven with oaths, to wit, that neither Helen, nor the treasures claimed,\\nwere in their possession,- both the one and the other had remained,\\nthey said, in Egypt; and it was not just to come upon them for what\\nProteus, king of Egypt, was detaining. The Greeks, imagining that\\nthe Teucrians were merely laughing at them, laid siege to the town,\\nand never rested until they finally took it. As, however, no Helen\\nwas found, and they were still told the same story, they at length\\nbelieved in its truth, and despatched Menelaus to the court of Proteus.\\n\\nSo Menelaus travelled to Egypt, and on his arrival sailed up the river\\nas far as Memphis, and related all that had happened. He met with\\nthe utmost hospitality, received Helen back unharmed, and recovered\\nall his treasures. After this friendly treatment Menelaus, they said,\\nbehaved most unjustly towards the Egyptians; for as it happened that\\nat the time when he wanted to take his departure, he was detained\\nby the wind being contrary, and as he found this obstruction continue,\\nhe had recourse to a most wicked expedient. He seized, they said,\\ntwo children of the people of the country, and offered them up in\\nsacrifice. When this became known, the indignation of the people was\\nstirred, and they went in pursuit of Menelaus, who, however, escaped\\nwith his ships to Libya, after which the Egyptians could not say whither\\nhe went. The rest they knew full well, partly by the inquiries which\\nthey had made, and partly from the circumstances having taken place\\nin their own land, and therefore not admitting of doubt.\\n\\nSuch is the account given by the Egyptian priests, and I am myself\\ninclined to regard as true all that they say of Helen from the following\\nconsiderations:- If Helen had been at Troy, the inhabitants would,\\nI think, have given her up to the Greeks, whether Alexander consented\\nto it or no. For surely neither Priam, nor his family, could have\\nbeen so infatuated as to endanger their own persons, their children,\\nand their city, merely that Alexander might possess Helen. At any\\nrate, if they determined to refuse at first, yet afterwards when so\\nmany of the Trojans fell on every encounter with the Greeks, and Priam\\ntoo in each battle lost a son, or sometimes two, or three, or even\\nmore, if we may credit the epic poets, I do not believe that even\\nif Priam himself had been married to her he would have declined to\\ndeliver her up, with the view of bringing the series of calamities\\nto a close. Nor was it as if Alexander had been heir to the crown,\\nin which case he might have had the chief management of affairs, since\\nPriam was already old. Hector, who was his elder brother, and a far\\nbraver man, stood before him, and was the heir to the kingdom on the\\ndeath of their father Priam. And it could not be Hector\\'s interest\\nto uphold his brother in his wrong, when it brought such dire calamities\\nupon himself and the other Trojans. But the fact was that they had\\nno Helen to deliver, and so they told the Greeks, but the Greeks would\\nnot believe what they said- Divine Providence, as I think, so willing,\\nthat by their utter destruction it might be made evident to all men\\nthat when great wrongs are done, the gods will surely visit them with\\ngreat punishments. Such, at least, is my view of the matter.\\n\\n1. When Proteus died, Rhampsinitus, the priests informed me, succeeded\\nto the throne. His monuments were the western gateway of the temple\\nof Vulcan, and the two statues which stand in front of this gateway,\\ncalled by the Egyptians, the one Summer, the other Winter, each twenty-five\\ncubits in height. The statue of Summer, which is the northernmost\\nof the two, is worshipped by the natives, and has offerings made to\\nit; that of Winter, which stands towards the south, is treated in\\nexactly the contrary way. King Rhampsinitus was possessed, they said,\\nof great riches in silver- indeed to such an amount, that none of\\nthe princes, his successors, surpassed or even equalled his wealth.\\nFor the better custody of this money, he proposed to build a vast\\nchamber of hewn stone, one side of which was to form a part of the\\nouter wall of his palace. The builder, therefore, having designs upon\\nthe treasures, contrived, as he was making the building, to insert\\nin this wall a stone, which could easily be removed from its place\\nby two men, or even by one. So the chamber was finished, and the king\\'s\\nmoney stored away in it. Time passed, and the builder fell sick, when\\nfinding his end approaching, he called for his two sons, and related\\nto them the contrivance he had made in the king\\'s treasure-chamber,\\ntelling them it was for their sakes he had done it, that so they might\\nalways live in affluence. Then he gave them clear directions concerning\\nthe mode of removing the stone, and communicated the measurements,\\nbidding them carefully keep the secret, whereby they would be Comptrollers\\nof the Royal Exchequer so long as they lived. Then the father died,\\nand the sons were not slow in setting to work: they went by night\\nto the palace, found the stone in the wall of the building, and having\\nremoved it with ease, plundered the treasury of a round sum.\\n\\n2. When the king next paid a visit to the apartment, he was astonished\\nto see that the money was sunk in some of the vessels wherein it was\\nstored away. Whom to accuse, however, he knew not, as the seals were\\nall perfect, and the fastenings of the room secure. Still each time\\nthat he repeated his visits, he found that more money was gone. The\\nthieves in truth never stopped, but plundered the treasury ever more\\nand more. At last the king determined to have some traps made, and\\nset near the vessels which contained his wealth. This was done, and\\nwhen the thieves came, as usual, to the treasure-chamber, and one\\nof them entering through the aperture, made straight for the jars,\\nsuddenly he found himself caught in one of the traps. Perceiving that\\nhe was lost, he instantly called his brother and telling him what\\nhad happened, entreated him to enter as quickly as possible and cut\\noff his head, that when his body should be discovered it might not\\nbe recognised, which would have the effect of bringing ruin upon both.\\nThe other thief thought the advice good, and was persuaded to follow\\nit then, fitting the stone into its place, he went home, taking with\\nhim his brother\\'s head. \\n\\n3. When day dawned, the king came into the room, and marvelled greatly\\nto see the body of the thief in the trap without a head, while the\\nbuilding was still whole, and neither entrance nor exit was to be\\nseen anywhere. In this perplexity he commanded the body of the dead\\nman to be hung up outside the palace wall, and set a guard to watch\\nit, with orders that if any persons were seen weeping or lamenting\\nnear the place, they should be seized and brought before him. When\\nthe mother heard of this exposure of the corpse of her son, she took\\nit sorely to heart, and spoke to her surviving child, bidding him\\ndevise some plan or other to get back the body, and threatening, that\\nif he did not exert himself, she would go herself to the king, and\\ndenounce him as the robber. \\n\\n4. The son said all he could to persuade her to let the matter rest,\\nbut in vain; she still continued to trouble him, until at last he\\nyielded to her importunity, and contrived as follows:- Filling some\\nskins with wine, he loaded them on donkeys, which he drove before\\nhim till he came to the place where the guards were watching the dead\\nbody, when pulling two or three of the skins towards him, he untied\\nsome of the necks which dangled by the asses\\' sides. The wine poured\\nfreely out, whereupon he began to beat his head, and shout with all\\nhis might, seeming not to know which of the donkeys he should turn\\nto first. When the guards saw the wine running, delighted to profit\\nby the occasion, they rushed one and all into the road, each with\\nsome vessel or other, and caught the liquor as it was spilling. The\\ndriver pretended anger, and loaded them with abuse; whereon they did\\ntheir best to pacify him, until at last he appeared to soften, and\\nrecover his good humour, drove his asses aside out of the road, and\\nset to work to rearrange their burthens; meanwhile, as he talked and\\nchatted with the guards, one of them began to rally him, and make\\nhim laugh, whereupon he gave them one of the skins as a gift. They\\nnow made up their minds to sit down and have a drinking-bout where\\nthey were, so they begged him to remain and drink with them. Then\\nthe man let himself be persuaded, and stayed. As the drinking went\\non, they grew very friendly together, so presently he gave them another\\nskin, upon which they drank so copiously that they were all overcome\\nwith the liquor, and growing drowsy lay down, and fell asleep on the\\nspot. The thief waited till it was the dead of the night, and then\\ntook down the body of his brother; after which, in mockery, he shaved\\noff the right side of all the soldiers\\' beards, and so left them.\\nLaying his brother\\'s body upon the asses, he carried it home to his\\nmother, having thus accomplished the thing that she had required of\\nhim. \\n\\n5. When it came to the king\\'s ears that the thief\\'s body was stolen\\naway, he was sorely vexed. Wishing, therefore, whatever it might cost,\\nto catch the man who had contrived the trick, he had recourse (the\\npriests said) to an expedient, which I can scarcely credit. He sent\\nhis own daughter to the common stews, with orders to admit all comers,\\nbut to require every man to tell her what was the cleverest and wickedest\\nthing he had done in the whole course of his life. If any one in reply\\ntold her the story of the thief, she was to lay hold of him and not\\nallow him to get away. The daughter did as her father willed, whereon\\nthe thief, who was well aware of the king\\'s motive, felt a desire\\nto outdo him in craft and cunning. Accordingly he contrived the following\\nplan:- He procured the corpse of a man lately dead, and cutting of\\none of the arms at the shoulder, put it under his dress, and so went\\nto the king\\'s daughter. When she put the question to him as she had\\ndone to all the rest, he replied that the wickedest thing he had ever\\ndone was cutting off the head of his brother when he was caught in\\na trap in the king\\'s treasury, and the cleverest was making the guards\\ndrunk and carrying off the body. As he spoke, the princess caught\\nat him, but the thief took advantage of the darkness to hold out to\\nher the hand of the corpse. Imagining it to be his own hand, she seized\\nand held it fast; while the thief, leaving it in her grasp, made his\\nescape by the door. \\n\\n6. The king, when word was brought him of this fresh success, amazed\\nat the sagacity and boldness of the man, sent messengers to all the\\ntowns in his dominions to proclaim a free pardon for the thief, and\\nto promise him a rich reward, if he came and made himself known. The\\nthief took the king at his word, and came boldly into his presence;\\nwhereupon Rhampsinitus, greatly admiring him, and looking on him as\\nthe most knowing of men, gave him his daughter in marriage. \"The Egyptians,\"\\nhe said, \"excelled all the rest of the world in wisdom, and this man\\nexcelled all other Egyptians.\" \\n\\nThe same king, I was also informed by the priests, afterwards descended\\nalive into the region which the Greeks call Hades, and there played\\nat dice with Ceres, sometimes winning and sometimes suffering defeat.\\nAfter a while he returned to earth, and brought with him a golden\\nnapkin, a gift which he had received from the goddess. From this descent\\nof Rhampsinitus into Hades, and return to earth again, the Egyptians,\\nI was told, instituted a festival, which they certainly celebrated\\nin my day. On what occasion it was that they instituted it, whether\\nupon this or upon any other, I cannot determine. The following are\\nthe ceremonies:- On a certain day in the year the priests weave a\\nmande, and binding the eyes of one of their number with a fillet,\\nthey put the mantle upon him, and take him with them into the roadway\\nconducting to the temple of Ceres, when they depart and leave him\\nto himself. Then the priest, thus blindfolded, is led (they say) by\\ntwo wolves to the temple of Ceres, distant twenty furlongs from the\\ncity, where he stays awhile, after which he is brought back from the\\ntemple by the wolves, and left upon the spot where they first joined\\nhim. \\n\\nSuch as think the tales told by the Egyptians credible are free to\\naccept them for history. For my own part, I propose to myself throughout\\nmy whole work faithfully to record the traditions of the several nations.\\nThe Egyptians maintain that Ceres and Bacchus preside in the realms\\nbelow. They were also the first to broach the opinion that the soul\\nof man is immortal and that, when the body dies, it enters into the\\nform of an animal which is born at the moment, thence passing on from\\none animal into another, until it has circled through the forms of\\nall the creatures which tenant the earth, the water, and the air,\\nafter which it enters again into a human frame, and is born anew.\\nThe whole period of the transmigration is (they say) three thousand\\nyears. There are Greek writers, some of an earlier, some of a later\\ndate, who have borrowed this doctrine from the Egyptians, and put\\nit forward as their own. I could mention their names, but I abstain\\nfrom doing so. \\n\\nTill the death of Rhampsinitus, the priests said, Egypt was excellently\\ngoverned, and flourished greatly; but after him Cheops succeeded to\\nthe throne, and plunged into all manner of wickedness. He closed the\\ntemples, and forbade the Egyptians to offer sacrifice, compelling\\nthem instead to labour, one and all, in his service. Some were required\\nto drag blocks of stone down to the Nile from the quarries in the\\nArabian range of hills; others received the blocks after they had\\nbeen conveyed in boats across the river, and drew them to the range\\nof hills called the Libyan. A hundred thousand men laboured constantly,\\nand were relieved every three months by a fresh lot. It took ten years\\'\\noppression of the people to make the causeway for the conveyance of\\nthe stones, a work not much inferior, in my judgment, to the pyramid\\nitself. This causeway is five furlongs in length, ten fathoms wide,\\nand in height, at the highest part, eight fathoms. It is built of\\npolished stone, and is covered with carvings of animals. To make it\\ntook ten years, as I said- or rather to make the causeway, the works\\non the mound where the pyramid stands, and the underground chambers,\\nwhich Cheops intended as vaults for his own use: these last were built\\non a sort of island, surrounded by water introduced from the Nile\\nby a canal. The pyramid itself was twenty years in building. It is\\na square, eight hundred feet each way, and the height the same, built\\nentirely of polished stone, fitted together with the utmost care.\\nThe stones of which it is composed are none of them less than thirty\\nfeet in length. \\n\\nThe pyramid was built in steps, battlement-wise, as it is called,\\nor, according to others, altar-wise. After laying the stones for the\\nbase, they raised the remaining stones to their places by means of\\nmachines formed of short wooden planks. The first machine raised them\\nfrom the ground to the top of the first step. On this there was another\\nmachine, which received the stone upon its arrival, and conveyed it\\nto the second step, whence a third machine advanced it still higher.\\nEither they had as many machines as there were steps in the pyramid,\\nor possibly they had but a single machine, which, being easily moved,\\nwas transferred from tier to tier as the stone rose- both accounts\\nare given, and therefore I mention both. The upper portion of the\\npyramid was finished first, then the middle, and finally the part\\nwhich was lowest and nearest the ground. There is an inscription in\\nEgyptian characters on the pyramid which records the quantity of radishes,\\nonions, and garlic consumed by the labourers who constructed it; and\\nI perfectly well remember that the interpreter who read the writing\\nto me said that the money expended in this way was 1600 talents of\\nsilver. If this then is a true record, what a vast sum must have been\\nspent on the iron tools used in the work, and on the feeding and clothing\\nof the labourers, considering the length of time the work lasted,\\nwhich has already been stated, and the additional time- no small space,\\nI imagine- which must have been occupied by the quarrying of the stones,\\ntheir conveyance, and the formation of the underground apartments.\\n\\nThe wickedness of Cheops reached to such a pitch that, when he had\\nspent all his treasures and wanted more, he sent his daughter to the\\nstews, with orders to procure him a certain sum- how much I cannot\\nsay, for I was not told; she procured it, however, and at the same\\ntime, bent on leaving a monument which should perpetuate her own memory,\\nshe required each man to make her a present of a stone towards the\\nworks which she contemplated. With these stones she built the pyramid\\nwhich stands midmost of the three that are in front of the great pyramid,\\nmeasuring along each side a hundred and fifty feet. \\n\\nCheops reigned, the Egyptians said, fifty years, and was succeeded\\nat his demise by Chephren, his brother. \\n\\nChephren imitated the conduct of his predecessor, and, like him, built\\na pyramid, which did not, however, equal the dimensions of his brother\\'s.\\nOf this I am certain, for I measured them both myself. It has no subterraneous\\napartments, nor any canal from the Nile to supply it with water, as\\nthe other pyramid has. In that, the Nile water, introduced through\\nan artificial duct, surrounds an island, where the body of Cheops\\nis said to lie. Chephren built his pyramid close to the great pyramid\\nof Cheops, and of the same dimensions, except that he lowered the\\nheight forty feet. For the basement he employed the many-coloured\\nstone of Ethiopia. These two pyramids stand both on the same hill,\\nan elevation not far short of a hundred feet in height. The reign\\nof Chephren lasted fifty-six years. \\n\\nThus the affliction of Egypt endured for the space of one hundred\\nand six years, during the whole of which time the temples were shut\\nup and never opened. The Egyptians so detest the memory of these kings\\nthat they do not much like even to mention their names. Hence they\\ncommonly call the pyramids after Philition, a shepherd who at that\\ntime fed his flocks about the place. \\n\\nAfter Chephren, Mycerinus (they said), son of Cheops, ascended the\\nthrone. This prince disapproved the conduct of his father, re-opened\\nthe temples, and allowed the people, who were ground down to the lowest\\npoint of misery, to return to their occupations, and to resume the\\npractice of sacrifice. His justice in the decision of causes was beyond\\nthat of all the former kings. The Egyptians praise him in this respect\\nmore highly than any of their other monarchs, declaring that he not\\nonly gave his judgments with fairness, but also, when any one was\\ndissatisfied with his sentence, made compensation to him out of his\\nown purse, and thus pacified his anger. Mycerinus had established\\nhis character for mildness, and was acting as I have described, when\\nthe stroke of calamity fell on him. First of all his daughter died,\\nthe only child that he possessed. Experiencing a bitter grief at this\\nvisitation, in his sorrow he conceived the wish to entomb his child\\nin some unusual way. He therefore caused a cow to be made of wood,\\nand after the interior had been hollowed out, he had the whole surface\\ncoated with gold; and in this novel tomb laid the dead body of his\\ndaughter. \\n\\nThe cow was not placed under ground, but continued visible to my times:\\nit was at Sais, in the royal palace, where it occupied a chamber richly\\nadorned. Every day there are burnt before it aromatics of every kind;\\nand all night long a lamp is kept burning in the apartment. In an\\nadjoining chamber are statues which the priests at Sais, declared\\nto represent the various concubines of Mycerinus. They are colossal\\nfigures in wood, of the number of about twenty, and are represented\\nnaked. Whose images they really are, I cannot say- I can only repeat\\nthe account which was given to me. \\n\\nConcerning these colossal figures and the sacred cow, there is also\\nanother tale narrated, which runs thus: \"Mycerinus was enamoured of\\nhis daughter, and offered her violence- the damsel for grief hanged\\nherself, and Mycerinus entombed her in the cow. Then her mother cut\\noff the hands of all her tiring- maids, because they had sided with\\nthe father, and betrayed the child; and so the statues of the maids\\nhave no hands.\" All this is mere fable in my judgment, especially\\nwhat is said about the hands of the colossal statues. I could plainly\\nsee that the figures had only lost their hands through the effect\\nof time. They had dropped off, and were still lying on the ground\\nabout the feet of the statues. \\n\\nAs for the cow, the greater portion of it is hidden by a scarlet coverture;\\nthe head and neck, however, which are visible, are coated very thickly\\nwith gold, and between the horns there is a representation in gold\\nof the orb of the sun. The figure is not erect, but lying down, with\\nthe limbs under the body; the dimensions being fully those of a large\\nanimal of the kind. Every year it is taken from the apartment where\\nit is kept, and exposed to the light of day- this is done at the season\\nwhen the Egyptians beat themselves in honour of one of their gods,\\nwhose name I am unwilling to mention in connection with such a matter.\\nThey say that the daughter of Mycerinus requested her father in her\\ndying moments to allow her once a year to see the sun. \\n\\nAfter the death of his daughter, Mycerinus was visited with a second\\ncalamity, of which I shall now proceed to give an account. An oracle\\nreached him from the town of Buto, which said, \"Six years only shalt\\nthou live upon the earth, and in the seventh thou shalt end thy days.\"\\nMycerinus, indignant, sent an angry message to the oracle, reproaching\\nthe god with his injustice- \"My father and uncle,\" he said, \"though\\nthey shut up the temples, took no thought of the gods, and destroyed\\nmultitudes of men, nevertheless enjoyed a long life; I, who am pious,\\nam to die so soon!\" There came in reply a second message from the\\noracle- \"For this very reason is thy life brought so quickly to a\\nclose- thou hast not done as it behoved thee. Egypt was fated to suffer\\naffliction one hundred and fifty years- the two kings who preceded\\nthee upon the throne understood this- thou hast not understood it.\"\\nMycerinus, when this answer reached him, perceiving that his doom\\nwas fixed, had prepared, which he lighted every day at eventime, and\\nfeasted and enjoyed himself unceasingly both day and night, moving\\nabout in the marsh-country and the woods, and visiting all the places\\nthat he heard were agreeable sojourns. His wish was to prove the oracle\\nfalse, by turning the nights into days, and so living twelve years\\nin the space of six. \\n\\nHe too left a pyramid, but much inferior in size to his father\\'s.\\nIt is a square, each side of which falls short of three plethra by\\ntwenty feet, and is built for half its height of the stone of Ethiopia.\\nSome of the Greeks call it the work of Rhodopis the courtesan, but\\nthey report falsely. It seems to me that these persons cannot have\\nany real knowledge who Rhodopis was; otherwise they would scarcely\\nhave ascribed to her a work on which uncounted treasures, so to speak,\\nmust have been expended. Rhodopis also lived during the reign of Amasis,\\nnot of Mycerinus, and was thus very many years later than the time\\nof the kings who built the pyramids. She was a Thracian by birth,\\nand was the slave of Iadmon, son of Hephaestopolis, a Samian. Aesop,\\nthe fable-writer, was one of her fellow-slaves. That Aesop belonged\\nto Iadmon is proved by many facts- among others, by this. When the\\nDelphians, in obedience to the command of the oracle, made proclamation\\nthat if any one claimed compensation for the murder of Aesop he should\\nreceive it, the person who at last came forward was Iadmon, grandson\\nof the former Iadmon, and he received the compensation. Aesop therefore\\nmust certainly have been the former Iadmon\\'s slave. \\n\\nRhodopis really arrived in Egypt under the conduct of Xantheus the\\nSamian; she was brought there to exercise her trade, but was redeemed\\nfor a vast sum by Charaxus, a Mytilenaean, the son of Scamandronymus,\\nand brother of Sappho the poetess. After thus obtaining her freedom,\\nshe remained in Egypt, and, as she was very beautiful, amassed great\\nwealth, for a person in her condition; not, however, enough to enable\\nher to erect such a work as this pyramid. Any one who likes may go\\nand see to what the tenth part of her wealth amounted, and he will\\nthereby learn that her riches must not be imagined to have been very\\nwonderfully great. Wishing to leave a memorial of herself in Greece,\\nshe determined to have something made the like of which was not to\\nbe found in any temple, and to offer it at the shrine at Delphi. So\\nshe set apart a tenth of her possessions, and purchased with the money\\na quantity of iron spits, such as are fit for roasting oxen whole,\\nwhereof she made a present to the oracle. They are still to be seen\\nthere, lying of a heap, behind the altar which the Chians dedicated,\\nopposite the sanctuary. Naucratis seems somehow to be the place where\\nsuch women are most attractive. First there was this Rhodopis of whom\\nwe have been speaking, so celebrated a person that her name came to\\nbe familiar to all the Greeks; and, afterwards, there was another,\\ncalled Archidice, notorious throughout Greece, though not so much\\ntalked of as her predecessor. Charaxus, after ransoming Rhodopis,\\nreturned to Mytilene, and was often lashed by Sappho in her poetry.\\nBut enough has been said on the subject of this courtesan.\\n\\nAfter Mycerinus, the priests said, Asychis ascended the throne. He\\nbuilt the eastern gateway of the temple of Vulcan, which in size and\\nbeauty far surpasses the other three. All the four gateways have figures\\ngraven on them, and a vast amount of architectural ornament, but the\\ngateway of Asychis is by far the most richly adorned. In the reign\\nof this king, money being scarce and commercial dealings straitened,\\na law was passed that the borrower might pledge his father\\'s body\\nto raise the sum whereof he had need. A proviso was appended to this\\nlaw, giving the lender authority over the entire sepulchre of the\\nborrower, so that a man who took up money under this pledge, if he\\ndied without paying the debt, could not obtain burial either in his\\nown ancestral tomb, or in any other, nor could he during his lifetime\\nbury in his own tomb any member of his family. The same king, desirous\\nof eclipsing all his predecessors upon the throne, left as a monument\\nof his reign a pyramid of brick. It bears an inscription, cut in stone,\\nwhich runs thus:- \"Despise me not in comparison with the stone pyramids;\\nfor I surpass them all, as much as Jove surpasses the other gods.\\nA pole was plunged into a lake, and the mud which clave thereto was\\ngathered; and bricks were made of the mud, and so I was formed.\" Such\\nwere the chief actions of this prince. \\n\\nHe was succeeded on the throne, they said, by a blind man, a native\\nof Anysis, whose own name also was Anysis. Under him Egypt was invaded\\nby a vast army of Ethiopians, led by Sabacos, their king. The blind\\nAnysis fled away to the marsh-country, and the Ethiopian was lord\\nof the land for fifty years, during which his mode of rule was the\\nfollowing:- When an Egyptian was guilty of an offence, his plan was\\nnot to punish him with death: instead of so doing, he sentenced him,\\naccording to the nature of his crime, to raise the ground to a greater\\nor a less extent in the neighbourhood of the city to which he belonged.\\nThus the cities came to be even more elevated than they were before.\\nAs early as the time of Sesostris, they had been raised by those who\\ndug the canals in his reign; this second elevation of the soil under\\nthe Ethiopian king gave them a very lofty position. Among the many\\ncities which thus attained to a great elevation, none (I think) was\\nraised so much as the town called Bubastis, where there is a temple\\nof the goddess Bubastis, which well deserves to be described. Other\\ntemples may be grander, and may have cost more in the building, but\\nthere is none so pleasant to the eye as this of Bubastis. The Bubastis\\nof the Egyptians is the same as the Artemis (Diana) of the Greeks.\\n\\nThe following is a description of this edifice:- Excepting the entrance,\\nthe whole forms an island. Two artificial channels from the Nile,\\none on either side of the temple, encompass the building, leaving\\nonly a narrow passage by which it is approached. These channels are\\neach a hundred feet wide, and are thickly shaded with trees. The gateway\\nis sixty feet in height, and is ornamented with figures cut upon the\\nstone, six cubits high and well worthy of notice. The temple stands\\nin the middle of the city, and is visible on all sides as one walks\\nround it; for as the city has been raised up by embankment, while\\nthe temple has been left untouched in its original condition, you\\nlook down upon it wheresoever you are. A low wall runs round the enclosure,\\nhaving figures engraved upon it, and inside there is a grove of beautiful\\ntall trees growing round the shrine, which contains the image of the\\ngoddess. The enclosure is a furlong in length, and the same in breadth.\\nThe entrance to it is by a road paved with stone for a distance of\\nabout three furlongs, which passes straight through the market-place\\nwith an easterly direction, and is about four hundred feet in width.\\nTrees of an extraordinary height grow on each side the road, which\\nconducts from the temple of Bubastis to that of Mercury.\\n\\nThe Ethiopian finally quitted Egypt, the priests said, by a hasty\\nflight under the following circumstances. He saw in his sleep a vision:-\\na man stood by his side, and counselled him to gather together all\\nthe priests of Egypt and cut every one of them asunder. On this, according\\nto the account which he himself gave, it came into his mind that the\\ngods intended hereby to lead him to commit an act of sacrilege, which\\nwould be sure to draw down upon him some punishment either at the\\nhands of gods or men. So he resolved not to do the deed suggested\\nto him, but rather to retire from Egypt, as the time during which\\nit was fated that he should hold the country had now (he thought)\\nexpired. For before he left Ethiopia he had been told by the oracles\\nwhich are venerated there, that he was to reign fifty years over Egypt.\\nThe years were now fled, and the dream had come to trouble him; he\\ntherefore of his own accord withdrew from the land. \\n\\nAs soon as Sabacos was gone, the blind king left the marshes, and\\nresumed the government. He had lived in the marsh-region the whole\\ntime, having formed for himself an island there by a mixture of earth\\nand ashes. While he remained, the natives had orders to bring him\\nfood unbeknown to the Ethiopian, and latterly, at his request, each\\nman had brought him, with the food, a certain quantity of ashes. Before\\nAmyrtaeus, no one was able to discover the site of this island, which\\ncontinued unknown to the kings of Egypt who preceded him on the throne\\nfor the space of seven hundred years and more. The name which it bears\\nis Elbo. It is about ten furlongs across in each direction.\\n\\nThe next king, I was told, was a priest of Vulcan, called Sethos.\\nThis monarch despised and neglected the warrior class of the Egyptians,\\nas though he did not need their services. Among other indignities\\nwhich he offered them, he took from them the lands which they had\\npossessed under all the previous kings, consisting of twelve acres\\nof choice land for each warrior. Afterwards, therefore, when Sanacharib,\\nking of the Arabians and Assyrians, marched his vast army into Egypt,\\nthe warriors one and all refused to come to his aid. On this the monarch,\\ngreatly distressed, entered into the inner sanctuary, and, before\\nthe image of the god, bewailed the fate which impended over him. As\\nhe wept he fell asleep, and dreamed that the god came and stood at\\nhis side, bidding him be of good cheer, and go boldly forth to meet\\nthe Arabian host, which would do him no hurt, as he himself would\\nsend those who should help him. Sethos, then, relying on the dream,\\ncollected such of the Egyptians as were willing to follow him, who\\nwere none of them warriors, but traders, artisans, and market people;\\nand with these marched to Pelusium, which commands the entrance into\\nEgypt, and there pitched his camp. As the two armies lay here opposite\\none another, there came in the night, a multitude of field-mice, which\\ndevoured all the quivers and bowstrings of the enemy, and ate the\\nthongs by which they managed their shields. Next morning they commenced\\ntheir fight, and great multitudes fell, as they had no arms with which\\nto defend themselves. There stands to this day in the temple of Vulcan,\\na stone statue of Sethos, with a mouse in his hand, and an inscription\\nto this effect- \"Look on me, and learn to reverence the gods.\"\\n\\nThus far I have spoken on the authority of the Egyptians and their\\npriests. They declare that from their first king to this last-mentioned\\nmonarch, the priest of Vulcan, was a period of three hundred and forty-one\\ngenerations; such, at least, they say, was the number both of their\\nkings, and of their high-priests, during this interval. Now three\\nhundred generations of men make ten thousand years, three generations\\nfilling up the century; and the remaining forty-one generations make\\nthirteen hundred and forty years. Thus the whole number of years is\\neleven thousand, three hundred and forty; in which entire space, they\\nsaid, no god had ever appeared in a human form; nothing of this kind\\nhad happened either under the former or under the later Egyptian kings.\\nThe sun, however, had within this period of time, on four several\\noccasions, moved from his wonted course, twice rising where he now\\nsets, and twice setting where he now rises. Egypt was in no degree\\naffected by these changes; the productions of the land, and of the\\nriver, remained the same; nor was there anything unusual either in\\nthe diseases or the deaths. \\n\\nWhen Hecataeus the historian was at Thebes, and, discoursing of his\\ngenealogy, traced his descent to a god in the person of his sixteenth\\nancestor, the priests of Jupiter did to him exactly as they afterwards\\ndid to me, though I made no boast of my family. They led me into the\\ninner sanctuary, which is a spacious chamber, and showed me a multitude\\nof colossal statues, in wood, which they counted up, and found to\\namount to the exact number they had said; the custom being for every\\nhigh priest during his lifetime to set up his statue in the temple.\\nAs they showed me the figures and reckoned them up, they assured me\\nthat each was the son of the one preceding him; and this they repeated\\nthroughout the whole line, beginning with the representation of the\\npriest last deceased, and continuing till they had completed the series.\\nWhen Hecataeus, in giving his genealogy, mentioned a god as his sixteenth\\nancestor, the priests opposed their genealogy to his, going through\\nthis list, and refusing to allow that any man was ever born of a god.\\nTheir colossal figures were each, they said, a Piromis, born of a\\nPiromis, and the number of them was three hundred and forty-five;\\nthrough the whole series Piromis followed Piromis, and the line did\\nnot run up either to a god or a hero. The word Piromis may be rendered\\n\"gentleman.\" \\n\\nOf such a nature were, they said, the beings represented by these\\nimages- they were very far indeed from being gods. However, in the\\ntimes anterior to them it was otherwise; then Egypt had gods for its\\nrulers, who dwelt upon the earth with men, one being always supreme\\nabove the rest. The last of these was Horus, the son of Osiris, called\\nby the Greeks Apollo. He deposed Typhon, and ruled over Egypt as its\\nlast god-king. Osiris is named Dionysus (Bacchus) by the Greeks.\\n\\nThe Greeks regard Hercules, Bacchus, and Pan as the youngest of the\\ngods. With the Egyptians, contrariwise, Pan is exceedingly ancient,\\nand belongs to those whom they call \"the eight gods,\" who existed\\nbefore the rest. Hercules is one of the gods of the second order,\\nwho are known as \"the twelve\"; and Bacchus belongs to the gods of\\nthe third order, whom the twelve produced. I have already mentioned\\nhow many years intervened according to the Egyptians between the birth\\nof Hercules and the reign of Amasis. From Pan to this period they\\ncount a still longer time; and even from Bacchus, who is the youngest\\nof the three, they reckon fifteen thousand years to the reign of that\\nking. In these matters they say they cannot be mistaken, as they have\\nalways kept count of the years, and noted them in their registers.\\nBut from the present day to the time of Bacchus, the reputed son of\\nSemele, daughter of Cadmus, is a period of not more than sixteen hundred\\nyears; to that of Hercules, son of Alcmena, is about nine hundred;\\nwhile to the time of Pan, son of Penelope (Pan, according to the Greeks,\\nwas her child by Mercury), is a shorter space than to the Trojan war,\\neight hundred years or thereabouts. \\n\\nIt is open to all to receive whichever he may prefer of these two\\ntraditions; my own opinion about them has been already declared. If\\nindeed these gods had been publicly known, and had grown old in Greece,\\nas was the case with Hercules, son of Amphitryon, Bacchus, son of\\nSemele, and Pan, son of Penelope, it might have been said that the\\nlast-mentioned personages were men who bore the names of certain previously\\nexisting deities. But Bacchus, according to the Greek tradition, was\\nno sooner born than he was sewn up in Jupiter\\'s thigh, and carried\\noff to Nysa, above Egypt, in Ethiopia; and as to Pan, they do not\\neven profess to know what happened to him after his birth. To me,\\ntherefore, it is quite manifest that the names of these gods became\\nknown to the Greeks after those of their other deities, and that they\\ncount their birth from the time when they first acquired a knowledge\\nof them. Thus far my narrative rests on the accounts given by the\\nEgyptians. \\n\\nIn what follows I have the authority, not of the Egyptians only, but\\nof others also who agree with them. I shall speak likewise in part\\nfrom my own observation. When the Egyptians regained their liberty\\nafter the reign of the priest of Vulcan, unable to continue any while\\nwithout a king, they divided Egypt into twelve districts, and set\\ntwelve kings over them. These twelve kings, united together by intermarriages,\\nruled Egypt in peace, having entered into engagements with one another\\nnot to depose any of their number, nor to aim at any aggrandisement\\nof one above the rest, but to dwell together in perfect amity. Now\\nthe reason why they made these stipulations, and guarded with care\\nagainst their infraction, was because at the very first establishment\\nof the twelve kingdoms an oracle had declared- \"That he among them\\nwho should pour in Vulcan\\'s temple a libation from a cup of bronze\\nwould become monarch of the whole land of Egypt.\" Now the twelve held\\ntheir meetings at all the temples. \\n\\nTo bind themselves yet more closely together, it seemed good to them\\nto leave a common monument. In pursuance of this resolution they made\\nthe Labyrinth which lies a little above Lake Moeris, in the neighbourhood\\nof the place called the city of Crocodiles. I visited this place,\\nand found it to surpass description; for if all the walls and other\\ngreat works of the Greeks could be put together in one, they would\\nnot equal, either for labour or expense, this Labyrinth; and yet the\\ntemple of Ephesus is a building worthy of note, and so is the temple\\nof Samos. The pyramids likewise surpass description, and are severally\\nequal to a number of the greatest works of the Greeks, but the Labyrinth\\nsurpasses the pyramids. It has twelve courts, all of them roofed,\\nwith gates exactly opposite one another, six looking to the north,\\nand six to the south. A single wall surrounds the entire building.\\nThere are two different sorts of chambers throughout- half under ground,\\nhalf above ground, the latter built upon the former; the whole number\\nof these chambers is three thousand, fifteen hundred of each kind.\\nThe upper chambers I myself passed through and saw, and what I say\\nconcerning them is from my own observation; of the underground chambers\\nI can only speak from report: for the keepers of the building could\\nnot be got to show them, since they contained (as they said) the sepulchres\\nof the kings who built the Labyrinth, and also those of the sacred\\ncrocodiles. Thus it is from hearsay only that I can speak of the lower\\nchambers. The upper chambers, however, I saw with my own eyes, and\\nfound them to excel all other human productions; for the passages\\nthrough the houses, and the varied windings of the paths across the\\ncourts excited in me infinite admiration as I passed from the courts\\ninto chambers, and from the chambers into colonnades, and from the\\ncolonnades into fresh houses, and again from these into courts unseen\\nbefore. The roof was throughout of stone, like the walls; and the\\nwalls were carved all over with figures; every court was surrounded\\nwith a colonnade which was built of white stones exquisitely fitted\\ntogether. At the corner of the Labyrinth stands a pyramid, forty fathoms\\nhigh, with large figures engraved on it, which is entered by a subterranean\\npassage. \\n\\nWonderful as is the Labyrinth, the work called the Lake of Moeris,\\nwhich is close by the Labyrinth, is yet more astonishing. The measure\\nof its circumference is sixty schoenes, or three thousand six hundred\\nfurlongs, which is equal to the entire length of Egypt along the sea-coast.\\nThe lake stretches in its longest direction from north to south, and\\nin its deepest parts is of the depth of fifty fathoms. It is manifestly\\nan artificial excavation, for nearly in the centre there stand two\\npyramids, rising to the height of fifty fathoms above the surface\\nof the water, and extending as far beneath, crowned each of them with\\na colossal statue sitting upon a throne. Thus these pyramids are one\\nhundred fathoms high, which is exactly a furlong (stadium) of six\\nhundred feet: the fathom being six feet in length, or four cubits,\\nwhich is the same thing, since a cubit measures six, and a foot four,\\npalms. The water of the lake does not come out of the ground, which\\nis here excessively dry, but is introduced by a canal from the Nile.\\nThe current sets for six months into the lake from the river, and\\nfor the next six months into the river from the lake. it runs outward\\nit returns a talent of silver daily to the royal treasury from the\\nfish that are taken, but when the current is the other way the return\\nsinks to one-third of that sum. \\n\\nThe natives told me that there was a subterranean passage from this\\nlake to the Libyan Syrtis, running westward into the interior by the\\nhills above Memphis. As I could not anywhere see the earth which had\\nbeen taken out when the excavation was made, and I was curious to\\nknow what had become of it, I asked the Egyptians who live closest\\nto the lake where the earth had been put. The answer that they gave\\nme I readily accepted as true, since I had heard of the same thing\\nbeing done at Nineveh of the Assyrians. There, once upon a time, certain\\nthieves, having formed a plan to get into their possession the vast\\ntreasures of Sardanapalus, the Ninevite king, which were laid up in\\nsubterranean treasuries, proceeded to tunnel a passage from the house\\nwhere they lived into the royal palace, calculating the distance and\\nthe direction. At nightfall they took the earth from the excavation\\nand carried it to the river Tigris, which ran by Nineveh, continuing\\nto get rid of it in this manner until they had accomplished their\\npurpose. It was exactly in the same way that the Egyptians disposed\\nof the mould from their excavation, except that they did it by day\\nand not by night; for as fast as the earth was dug, they carried it\\nto the Nile, which they knew would disperse it far and wide. Such\\nwas the account which I received of the formation of this lake.\\n\\nThe twelve kings for some time dealt honourably by one another, but\\nat length it happened that on a certain occasion, when they had met\\nto worship in the temple of Vulcan, the high-priest on the last day\\nof the festival, in bringing forth the golden goblets from which they\\nwere wont to pour the libations, mistook the number and brought eleven\\ngoblets only for the twelve princes. Psammetichus was standing last,\\nand, being left without a cup, he took his helmet, which was of bronze,\\nfrom off his head, stretched it out to receive the liquor, and so\\nmade his libation. All the kings were accustomed to wear helmets,\\nand all indeed wore them at this very time. Nor was there any crafty\\ndesign in the action of Psammetichus. The eleven, however, when they\\ncame to consider what had been done, and bethought them of the oracle\\nwhich had declared \"that he who, of the twelve, should pour a libation\\nfrom a cup of bronze, the same would be king of the whole land of\\nEgypt,\" doubted at first if they should not put Psammetichus to death.\\nFinding, however, upon examination, that he had acted in the matter\\nwithout any guilty intent, they did not think it would be just to\\nkill him; but determined, instead, to strip him of the chief part\\nof his power and to banish him to the marshes, forbidding him to leave\\nthem or to hold any communication with the rest of Egypt.\\n\\nThis was the second time that Psammetichus had been driven into banishment.\\nOn a former occasion he had fled from Sabacos the Ethiopian, who had\\nput his father Necos to death; and had taken refuge in Syria from\\nwhence, after the retirement of the Ethiop in consequence of his dream,\\nhe was brought back by the Egyptians of the Saitic canton. Now it\\nwas his ill-fortune to be banished a second time by the eleven kings,\\non account of the libation which he had poured from his helmet; on\\nthis occasion he fled to the marshes. Feeling that he was an injured\\nman, and designing to avenge himself upon his persecutors, Psammetichus\\nsent to the city of Buto, where there is an oracle of Latona, the\\nmost veracious of all the oracles of the Egyptians, and having inquired\\nconcerning means of vengeance, received for answer that \"Vengeance\\nwould come from the sea, when brazen men should appear.\" Great was\\nhis incredulity when this answer arrived, for never, he thought, would\\nbrazen men arrive to be his helpers. However, not long afterwards\\ncertain Carians and Ionians who had left their country on a voyage\\nof plunder, were carried by stress of weather to Egypt where they\\ndisembarked, all equipped in their brazen armour, and were seen by\\nthe natives, one of whom carried the tidings to Psammetichus, and,\\nas he had never before seen men clad in brass, he reported that brazen\\nmen had come from the sea and were plundering the plain. Psammetichus,\\nperceiving at once that the oracle was accomplished, made friendly\\nadvances to the strangers, and engaged them, by splendid promises,\\nto enter into his service. He then, with their aid and that of the\\nEgyptians who espoused his cause, attacked the eleven and vanquished\\nthem. \\n\\nWhen Psammetichus had thus become sole monarch of Egypt, he built\\nthe southern gateway of the temple of Vulcan in Memphis, and also\\na court for Apis, in which Apis is kept whenever he makes his appearance\\nin Egypt. This court is opposite the gateway of Psammetichus, and\\nis surrounded with a colonnade and adorned with a multitude of figures.\\nInstead of pillars, the colonnade rests upon colossal statues, twelve\\ncubits in height. The Greek name for Apis is Epaphus. \\n\\nTo the Ionians and Carians who had lent him their assistance Psammetichus\\nassigned as abodes two places opposite to each other, one on either\\nside of the Nile, which received the name of \"the Camps.\" He also\\nmade good all the splendid promises by which he had gained their support;\\nand further, he intrusted to their care certain Egyptian children\\nwhom they were to teach the language of the Greeks. These children,\\nthus instructed, became the parents of the entire class of interpreters\\nin Egypt. The Ionians and Carians occupied for many years the places\\nassigned them by Psammetichus, which lay near the sea, a little below\\nthe city of Bubastis, on the Pelusiac mouth of the Nile. King Amasis\\nlong afterwards removed the Greeks hence, and settled them at Memphis\\nto guard him against the native Egyptians. From the date of the original\\nsettlement of these persons in Egypt, we Greeks, through our intercourse\\nwith them, have acquired an accurate knowledge of the several events\\nin Egyptian history, from the reign of Psammetichus downwards; but\\nbefore his time no foreigners had ever taken up their residence in\\nthat land. The docks where their vessels were laid up and the ruins\\nof their habitations were still to be seen in my day at the place\\nwhere they dwelt originally, before they were removed by Amasis. Such\\nwas the mode by which Psammetichus became master of Egypt.\\n\\nI have already made mention more than once of the Egyptian oracle,\\nand, as it well deserves notice, I shall now proceed to give an account\\nof it more at length. It is a temple of Latona, situated in the midst\\nof a great city on the Sebennytic mouth of the Nile, at some distance\\nup the river from the sea. The name of the city, as I have before\\nobserved, is Buto; and in it are two other temples also, one of Apollo\\nand one of Diana. Latona\\'s temple, which contains the oracle, is a\\nspacious building with a gateway ten fathoms in height. The most wonderful\\nthing that was actually to be seen about this temple was a chapel\\nin the enclosure made of a single stone, the length and height of\\nwhich were the same, each wall being forty cubits square, and the\\nwhole a single block! Another block of stone formed the roof and projected\\nat the eaves to the extent of four cubits. \\n\\nThis, as I have said, was what astonished me the most, of all the\\nthings that were actually to be seen about the temple. The next greatest\\nmarvel was the island called Chemmis. This island lies in the middle\\nof a broad and deep lake close by the temple, and the natives declare\\nthat it floats. For my own part I did not see it float, or even move;\\nand I wondered greatly, when they told me concerning it, whether there\\nbe really such a thing as a floating island. It has a grand temple\\nof Apollo built upon it, in which are three distinct altars. Palm\\ntrees grow on it in great abundance, and many other trees, some of\\nwhich bear fruit, while others are barren. The Egyptians tell the\\nfollowing story in connection with this island, to explain the way\\nin which it first came to float:- \"In former times, when the isle\\nwas still fixed and motionless, Latona, one of the eight gods of the\\nfirst order, who dwelt in the city of Buto, where now she has her\\noracle, received Apollo as a sacred charge from Isis, and saved him\\nby hiding him in what is now called the floating island. Typhon meanwhile\\nwas searching everywhere in hopes of finding the child of Osiris.\"\\n(According to the Egyptians, Apollo and Diana are the children of\\nBacchus and Isis, while Latona is their nurse and their preserver.\\nThey call Apollo, in their language, Horus; Ceres they call Isis;\\nDiana, Bubastis. From this Egyptian tradition, and from no other,\\nit must have been that Aeschylus, the son of Euphorion, took the idea,\\nwhich is found in none of the earlier poets, of making Diana the daughter\\nof Ceres.) The island, therefore, in consequence of this event, was\\nfirst made to float. Such at least is the account which the Egyptians\\ngive. \\n\\nPsammetichus ruled Egypt for fifty-four years, during twenty-nine\\nof which he pressed the siege of Azotus without intermission, till\\nfinally he took the place. Azotus is a great town in Syria. Of all\\nthe cities that we know, none ever stood so long a siege.\\n\\nPsammetichus left a son called Necos, who succeeded him upon the throne.\\nThis prince was the first to attempt the construction of the canal\\nto the Red Sea- a work completed afterwards by Darius the Persian-\\nthe length of which is four days\\' journey, and the width such as to\\nadmit of two triremes being rowed along it abreast. The water is derived\\nfrom the Nile, which the canal leaves a little above the city of Bubastis,\\nnear Patumus, the Arabian town, being continued thence until it joins\\nthe Red Sea. At first it is carried along the Arabian side of the\\nEgyptian plain, as far as the chain of hills opposite Memphis, whereby\\nthe plain is bounded, and in which lie the great stone quarries; here\\nit skirts the base of the hills running in a direction from west to\\neast, after which it turns and enters a narrow pass, trending southwards\\nfrom this point until it enters the Arabian Gulf. From the northern\\nsea to that which is called the southern or Erythraean, the shortest\\nand quickest passage, which is from Mount Casius, the boundary between\\nEgypt and Syria, to the Gulf of Arabia, is a distance of exactly one\\nthousand furlongs. But the way by the canal is very much longer on\\naccount of the crookedness of its course. A hundred and twenty thousand\\nof the Egyptians, employed upon the work in the reign of Necos, lost\\ntheir lives in making the excavation. He at length desisted from his\\nundertaking, in consequence of an oracle which warned him \"that he\\nwas labouring for the barbarian.\" The Egyptians call by the name of\\nbarbarians all such as speak a language different from their own.\\n\\nNecos, when he gave up the construction of the canal, turned all his\\nthoughts to war, and set to work to build a fleet of triremes, some\\nintended for service in the northern sea, and some for the navigation\\nof the Erythraean. These last were built in the Arabian Gulf where\\nthe dry docks in which they lay are still visible. These fleets he\\nemployed wherever he had occasion, while he also made war by land\\nupon the Syrians and defeated them in a pitched battle at Magdolus,\\nafter which he made himself master of Cadytis, a large city of Syria.\\nThe dress which he wore on these occasions he sent to Branchidae in\\nMilesia, as an offering to Apollo. After having reigned in all sixteen\\nyears, Necos died, and at his death bequeathed the throne to his son\\nPsammis. \\n\\nIn the reign of Psammis, ambassadors from Elis arrived in Egypt, boasting\\nthat their arrangements for the conduct of the Olympic Games were\\nthe best and fairest that could be devised, and fancying that not\\neven the Egyptians, who surpassed all other nations in wisdom, could\\nadd anything to their perfection. When these persons reached Egypt,\\nand explained the reason of their visit, the king summoned an assembly\\nof all the wisest of the Egyptians. They met, and the Eleans having\\ngiven them a full account of all their rules and regulations with\\nrespect to the contests said that they had come to Egypt for the express\\npurpose of learning whether the Egyptians could improve the fairness\\nof their regulations in any particular. The Egyptians considered awhile\\nand then made inquiry, \"If they allowed their own citizens to enter\\nthe lists?\" The Eleans answered, \"That the lists were open to all\\nGreeks, whether they belonged to Elis or to any other state.\" Hereupon\\nthe Egyptians observed, \"That if this were so, they departed from\\njustice very widely, since it was impossible but that they would favour\\ntheir own countrymen and deal unfairly by foreigners. If therefore\\nthey really wished to manage the games with fairness, and if this\\nwas the object of their coming to Egypt, they advised them to confine\\nthe contests to strangers, and allow no native of Elis to be a candidate.\"\\nSuch was the advice which the Egyptians gave to the Eleans.\\n\\nPsammis reigned only six years. He attacked Ethiopia, and died almost\\ndirectly afterwards. Apries, his son, succeeded him upon the throne,\\nwho, excepting Psammetichus, his great-grandfather, was the most prosperous\\nof all the kings that ever ruled over Egypt. The length of his reign\\nwas twenty-five years, and in the course of it he marched an army\\nto attack Sidon, and fought a battle with the king of Tyre by sea.\\nWhen at length the time came that was fated to bring him woe, an occasion\\narose which I shall describe more fully in my Libyan history, only\\ntouching it very briefly here. An army despatched by Apries to attack\\nCyrene, having met with a terrible reverse, the Egyptians laid the\\nblame on him, imagining that he had, of malice prepense, sent the\\ntroops into the jaws of destruction. They believed he had wished a\\nvast number of them to be slain in order that he himself might reign\\nwith more security over the rest of the Egyptians. Indignant therefore\\nat this usage, the soldiers who returned and the friends of the slain\\nbroke instantly into revolt. \\n\\nApries, on learning these circumstances, sent Amasis to the rebels\\nto appease the tumult by persuasion. Upon his arrival, as he was seek.\\ning to restrain the malcontents by his exhortations, one of them,\\ncoming behind him, put a helmet on his head, saying, as he put it\\non, that he thereby crowned him king. Amasis was not altogether displeased\\nat the action, as his conduct soon made manifest; for no sooner had\\nthe insurgents agreed to make him actually their king than he prepared\\nto march with them against Apries. That monarch, on tidings of these\\nevents reaching him, sent Patarbemis, one of his courtiers, a man\\nof high rank, to Amasis with orders to bring him alive into his presence.\\nPatarbemis, on arriving at the place where Amasis was, called on him\\nto come back with him to the king, whereupon Amasis broke a coarse\\njest, and said, \"Prythee take that back to thy master.\" When the envoy,\\nnotwithstanding this reply, persisted in his request, exhorting Amasis\\nto obey the summons of the king, he made answer \"that this was exactly\\nwhat he had long been intending to do; Apries would have no reason\\nto complain of him on the score of delay; he would shortly come himself\\nto the king, and bring others with him.\" Patarbemis, upon this, comprehending\\nthe intention of Amasis, partly from his replies and partly from the\\npreparations which he saw in progress, departed hastily, wishing to\\ninform the king with all speed of what was going on. Apries, however,\\nwhen he saw him approaching without Amasis, fell into a paroxysm of\\nrage, and not giving himself time for reflection, commanded the nose\\nand ears of Patarbemis to be cut off. Then the rest of the Egyptians,\\nwho had hitherto espoused the cause of Apries, when they saw a man\\nof such note among them so shamefully outraged, without a moment\\'s\\nhesitation went over to the rebels, and put themselves at the disposal\\nof Amasis. \\n\\nApries, informed of this new calamity, armed his mercenaries, and\\nled them against the Egyptians: this was a body of Carians and Ionians,\\nnumbering thirty thousand men, which was now with him at Says, where\\nhis palace stood- a vast building, well worthy of notice. The army\\nof Apries marched out to attack the host of the Egyptians, while that\\nof Amasis went forth to fight the strangers; and now both armies drew\\nnear the city of Momemphis and prepared for the coming fight.\\n\\nThe Egyptians are divided into seven distinct classes- these are,\\nthe priests, the warriors, the cowherds, the swineherds, the tradesmen,\\nthe interpreters, and the boatmen. Their titles indicate their occupations.\\nThe warriors consist of Hermotybians and Calascirians, who come from\\ndifferent cantons, the whole of Egypt being parcelled out into districts\\nbearing this name. \\n\\nThe following cantons furnish the Hermotybians:- The cantons of Busiris,\\nSais, Chemmis, Papremis, that of the island called Prosopitis, and\\nhalf of Natho. They number, when most numerous, a hundred and sixty\\nthousand. None of them ever practices a trade, but all are given wholly\\nto war. \\n\\nThe cantons of the Calascirians are different- they include the following:-\\nThe cantons of Thebes, Bubastis, Aphthis, Tanis, Mendes, Sebennytus,\\nAthribis, Pharbaethus, Thmuis, Onuphis, Anysis, and Myecphoris- this\\nlast canton consists of an island which lies over against the town\\nof Bubastis. The Calascirians, when at their greatest number, have\\namounted to two hundred and fifty thousand. Like the Hermotybians,\\nthey are forbidden to pursue any trade, and devote themselves entirely\\nto warlike exercises, the son following the father\\'s calling.\\n\\nWhether the Greeks borrowed from the Egyptians their notions about\\ntrade, like so many others, I cannot say for certain. I have remarked\\nthat the Thracians, the Scyths, the Persians, the Lydians, and almost\\nall other barbarians, hold the citizens who practice trades, and their\\nchildren, in less repute than the rest, while they esteem as noble\\nthose who keep aloof from handicrafts, and especially honour such\\nas are given wholly to war. These ideas prevail throughout the whole\\nof Greece, particularly among the Lacedaemonians. Corinth is the place\\nwhere mechanics are least despised. \\n\\nThe warrior class in Egypt had certain special privileges in which\\nnone of the rest of the Egyptians participated, except the priests.\\nIn the first place each man had twelve arurae of land assigned him\\nfree from tax. (The arura is a square of a hundred Egyptian cubits,\\nthe Egyptian cubit being of the same length as the Samian.) All the\\nwarriors enjoyed this privilege together, but there were other advantages\\nwhich came to each in rotation, the same man never obtaining them\\ntwice. A thousand Calascirians, and the same number of Hermotybians,\\nformed in alternate years the body-guard of the king; and during their\\nyear of service these persons, besides their arurae, received a daily\\nportion of meat and drink, consisting of five pounds of baked bread,\\ntwo pounds of beef, and four cups of wine. \\n\\nWhen Apries, at the head of his mercenaries, and Amasis, in command\\nof the whole native force of the Egyptians, encountered one another\\nnear the city of Momemphis, an engagement presently took place. The\\nforeign troops fought bravely, but were overpowered by numbers, in\\nwhich they fell very far short of their adversaries. It is said that\\nApries believed that there was not a god who could cast him down from\\nhis eminence, so firmly did he think that he had established himself\\nin his kingdom. But at this time the battle went against him, and\\nhis army being worsted, he fell into the enemy\\'s hands and was brought\\nback a prisoner to Sais, where he was lodged in what had been his\\nown house, but was now the palace of Amasis. Amasis treated him with\\nkindness, and kept him in the palace for a while; but finding his\\nconduct blamed by the Egyptians, who charged him with acting unjustly\\nin preserving a man who had shown himself so bitter an enemy both\\nto them and him, he gave Apries over into the hands of his former\\nsubjects, to deal with as they chose. Then the Egyptians took him\\nand strangled him, but having so done they buried him in the sepulchre\\nof his fathers. This tomb is in the temple of Minerva, very near the\\nsanctuary, on the left hand as one enters. The Saites buried all the\\nkings who belonged to their canton inside this temple; and thus it\\neven contains the tomb of Amasis, as well as that of Apries and his\\nfamily. The latter is not so close to the sanctuary as the former,\\nbut still it is within the temple. It stands in the court, and is\\na spacious cloister built of stone and adorned with pillars carved\\nso as to resemble palm trees, and with other sumptuous ornaments.\\nWithin the cloister is a chamber with folding doors, behind which\\nlies the sepulchre of the king. \\n\\nHere too, in this same precinct of Minerva at Sais, is the burial-place\\nof one whom I think it not right to mention in such a connection.\\nIt stands behind the temple, against the backwall, which it entirely\\ncovers. There are also some large stone obelisks in the enclosure,\\nand there is a lake near them, adorned with an edging of stone. In\\nform it is circular, and in size, as it seemed to me, about equal\\nto the lake in Delos called \"the Hoop.\" \\n\\nOn this lake it is that the Egyptians represent by night his sufferings\\nwhose name I refrain from mentioning, and this representation they\\ncall their Mysteries. I know well the whole course of the proceedings\\nin these ceremonies, but they shall not pass my lips. So too, with\\nregard to the mysteries of Ceres, which the Greeks term \"the Thesmophoria,\"\\nI know them, but I shall not mention them, except so far as may be\\ndone without impiety. The daughters of Danaus brought these rites\\nfrom Egypt, and taught them to the Pelasgic women of the Peloponnese.\\nAfterwards, when the inhabitants of the peninsula were driven from\\ntheir homes by the Dorians, the rites perished. Only in Arcadia, where\\nthe natives remained and were not compelled to migrate, their observance\\ncontinued. \\n\\nAfter Apries had been put to death in the way that I have described\\nabove, Amasis reigned over Egypt. He belonged to the canton of Sais,\\nbeing a native of the town called Siouph. At first his subjects looked\\ndown on him and held him in small esteem, because he had been a mere\\nprivate person, and of a house of no great distinction; but after\\na time Amasis succeeded in reconciling them to his rule, not by severity,\\nbut by cleverness. Among his other splendour he had a golden foot-pan,\\nin which his guests and himself were wont upon occasion to wash their\\nfeet. This vessel he caused to be broken in pieces, and made of the\\ngold an image of one of the gods, which he set up in the most public\\nplace in the whole city; upon which the Egyptians flocked to the image,\\nand worshipped it with the utmost reverence. Amasis, finding this\\nwas so, called an assembly, and opened the matter to them, explaining\\nhow the image had been made of the foot-pan, wherein they had been\\nwont formerly to wash their feet and to put all manner of filth, yet\\nnow it was greatly reverenced. \"And truly,\" he went on to say, \"it\\nhad gone with him as with the foot-pan. If he was a private person\\nformerly, yet now he had come to be their king. And so he bade them\\nhonour and reverence him.\" Such was the mode in which he won over\\nthe Egyptians, and brought them to be content to do him service.\\n\\nThe following was the general habit of his life:- from early dawn\\nto the time when the forum is wont to fill, he sedulously transacted\\nall the business that was brought before him; during the remainder\\nof the day he drank and joked with his guests, passing the time in\\nwitty and, sometimes, scarce seemly conversation. It grieved his friends\\nthat he should thus demean himself, and accordingly some of them chid\\nhim on the subject, saying to him- \"Oh! king, thou dost but ill guard\\nthy royal dignity whilst thou allowest thyself in such levities. Thou\\nshouldest sit in state upon a stately throne, and busy thyself with\\naffairs the whole day long. So would the Egyptians feel that a great\\nman rules them, and thou wouldst be better spoken of. But now thou\\nconductest thyself in no kingly fashion.\" Amasis answered them thus:-\\n\"Bowmen bend their bows when they wish to shoot; unbrace them when\\nthe shooting is over. Were they kept always strung they would break,\\nand fail the archer in time of need. So it is with men. If they give\\nthemselves constantly to serious work, and never indulge awhile in\\npastime or sport, they lose their senses, and become mad or moody.\\nKnowing this, I divide my life between pastime and business.\" Thus\\nhe answered his friends. \\n\\nIt is said that Amasis, even while he was a private man, had the same\\ntastes for drinking and jesting, and was averse to engaging in any\\nserious employment. He lived in constant feasts and revelries, and\\nwhenever his means failed him, he roamed about and robbed people.\\nOn such occasions the persons from whom he had stolen would bring\\nhim, if he denied the charge, before the nearest oracle; sometimes\\nthe oracle would pronounce him guilty of the theft, at other times\\nit would acquit him. When afterwards he came to be king, he neglected\\nthe temples of such gods as had declared that he was not a thief,\\nand neither contributed to their adornment nor frequented them for\\nsacrifice, since he regarded them as utterly worthless and their oracles\\nas wholly false: but the gods who had detected his guilt he considered\\nto be true gods whose oracles did not deceive, and these he honoured\\nexceedingly. \\n\\nFirst of all, therefore, he built the gateway of the temple of Minerva\\nat Sais, which is an astonishing work, far surpassing all other buildings\\nof the same kind both in extent and height, and built with stones\\nof rare size and excellency. In the next place, he presented to the\\ntemple a number of large colossal statues and several prodigious andro-sphinxes,\\nbesides certain stones for the repairs, of a most extraordinary size.\\nSome of these he got from the quarries over against Memphis, but the\\nlargest were brought from Elephantine, which is twenty days\\' voyage\\nfrom Sais. Of all these wonderful masses that which I most admire\\nis a chamber made of a single stone, which was quarried at Elephantine.\\nIt took three years to convey this block from the quarry to Sais;\\nand in the conveyance were employed no fewer than two thousand labourers,\\nwho were all from the class of boatmen. The length of this chamber\\non the outside is twenty-one cubits, its breadth fourteen cubits,\\nand its height, eight. The measurements inside are the following:-\\nthe length, eighteen cubits and five-sixths; the breadth, twelve cubits;\\nand the height, five. It lies near the entrance of the temple, where\\nit was left in consequence of the following circumstance:- it happened\\nthat the architect, just as the stone had reached the spot where it\\nnow stands, heaved a sigh, considering the length of time that the\\nremoval had taken, and feeling wearied with the heavy toil. The sigh\\nwas heard by Amasis who, regarding it as an omen, would not allow\\nthe chamber to be moved forward any farther. Some, however, say that\\none of the workmen engaged at the levers was crushed and killed by\\nthe mass, and that this was the reason of its being left where it\\nnow stands. \\n\\nTo the other temples of much note Amasis also made magnificent offerings-\\nat Memphis, for instance, he gave the recumbent colossus in front\\nof the temple of Vulcan, which is seventy-five feet long. Two other\\ncolossal statues stand on the same base, each twenty feet high, carved\\nin the stone of Ethiopia, one on either side of the temple. There\\nis also a stone colossus of the same size at Says, recumbent like\\nthat at Memphis. Amasis finally built the temple of Isis at Memphis,\\na vast structure, well worth seeing. \\n\\nIt is said that the reign of Amasis was the most prosperous time that\\nEgypt ever saw,- the river was more liberal to the land, and the land\\nbrought forth more abundantly for the service of man than had ever\\nbeen known before; while the number of inhabited cities was not less\\nthan twenty thousand. It was this king Amasis who established the\\nlaw that every Egyptian should appear once a year before the governor\\nof his canton, and show his means of living; or, failing to do so,\\nand to prove that he got an honest livelihood, should be put to death.\\nSolon the Athenian borrowed this law from the Egyptians, and imposed\\nit on his countrymen, who have observed it ever since. It is indeed\\nan excellent custom. \\n\\nAmasis was partial to the Greeks, and among other favours which he\\ngranted them, gave to such as liked to settle in Egypt the city of\\nNaucratis for their residence. To those who only wished to trade upon\\nthe coast, and did not want to fix their abode in the country, he\\ngranted certain lands where they might set up altars and erect temples\\nto the gods. Of these temples the grandest and most famous, which\\nis also the most frequented, is that called \"the Hellenium.\" It was\\nbuilt conjointly by the Ionians, Dorians, and Aeolians, the following\\ncities taking part in the work:- the Ionian states of Chios, Teos,\\nPhocaea, and Clazomenae; Rhodes, Cnidus, Halicarnassus, and Phaselis\\nof the Dorians; and Mytilene of the Aeolians. These are the states\\nto whom the temple belongs, and they have the right of appointing\\nthe governors of the factory; the other cities which claim a share\\nin the building, claim what in no sense belongs to them. Three nations,\\nhowever, consecrated for themselves separate temples- the Eginetans\\none to Jupiter, the Samians to Juno, and the Milesians to Apollo.\\n\\nIn ancient times there was no factory but Naucratis in the whole of\\nEgypt; and if a person entered one of the other mouths of the Nile,\\nhe was obliged to swear that he had not come there of his own free\\nwill. Having so done, he was bound to sail in his ship to the Canobic\\nmouth, or were that impossible owing to contrary winds, he must take\\nhis wares by boat all round the Delta, and so bring them to Naucratis,\\nwhich had an exclusive privilege. \\n\\nIt happened in the reign of Amasis that the temple of Delphi had been\\naccidentally burnt, and the Amphictyons had contracted to have it\\nrebuilt for three hundred talents, of which sum one-fourth was to\\nbe furnished by the Delphians. Under these circumstances the Delphians\\nwent from city to city begging contributions, and among their other\\nwanderings came to Egypt and asked for help. From few other places\\ndid they obtain so much- Amasis gave them a thousand talents of alum,\\nand the Greek settlers twenty minae. \\n\\nA league was concluded by Amasis with the Cyrenaeans, by which Cyrene\\nand Egypt became close friends and allies. He likewise took a wife\\nfrom that city, either as a sign of his friendly feeling, or because\\nhe had a fancy to marry a Greek woman. However this may be, certain\\nit is that he espoused a lady of Cyrene, by name Ladice, daughter,\\nsome say, of Battus or Arcesilaus, the king- others, of Critobulus,\\none of the chief citizens. When the time came to complete the contract,\\nAmasis was struck with weakness. Astonished hereat- for he was not\\nwont to be so afflicted- the king thus addressed his bride: \"Woman,\\nthou hast certainly bewitched me- now therefore be sure thou shalt\\nperish more miserably than ever woman perished yet.\" Ladice protested\\nher innocence, but in vain; Amasis was not softened. Hereupon she\\nmade a vow internally, that if he recovered within the day (for no\\nlonger time was allowed her), she would present a statue to the temple\\nof Venus at Cyrene. Immediately she obtained her wish, and the king\\'s\\nweakness disappeared. Amasis loved her greatly ever after, and Ladice\\nperformed her vow. The statue which she caused to be made, and sent\\nto Cyrene continued there to my day, standing with its face looking\\noutwards from the city. Ladice herself, when Cambyses conquered Egypt,\\nsuffered no wrong; for Cambyses, on learning of her who she was, sent\\nher back unharmed to her country. \\n\\nBesides the marks of favour already mentioned, Amasis also enriched\\nwith offerings many of the Greek temples. He sent to Cyrene a statue\\nof Minerva covered with plates of gold, and a painted likeness of\\nhimself. To the Minerva of Lindus he gave two statues in stone, and\\na linen corslet well worth inspection. To the Samian Juno he presented\\ntwo statues of himself, made in wood, which stood in the great temple\\nto my day, behind the doors. Samos was honoured with these gifts on\\naccount of the bond of friendship subsisting between Amasis and Polycrates,\\nthe son of Aeaces: Lindus, for no such reason, but because of the\\ntradition that the daughters of Danaus touched there in their flight\\nfrom the sons of Aegyptus, and built the temple of Minerva. Such were\\nthe offerings of Amasis. He likewise took Cyprus, which no man had\\never done before, and compelled it to pay him a tribute.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK III\\n\\nThalia \\n\\nThe above-mentioned Amasis was the Egyptian king against whom Cambyses,\\nson of Cyrus, made his expedition; and with him went an army composed\\nof the many nations under his rule, among them being included both\\nIonic and Aeolic Greeks. The reason of the invasion was the following.\\nCambyses, by the advice of a certain Egyptian, who was angry with\\nAmasis for having torn him from his wife and children and given him\\nover to the Persians, had sent a herald to Amasis to ask his daughter\\nin marriage. His adviser was a physician, whom Amasis, when Cyrus\\nhad requested that he would send him the most skilful of all the Egyptian\\neye-doctors, singled out as the best from the whole number. Therefore\\nthe Egyptian bore Amasis a grudge, and his reason for urging Cambyses\\nto ask the hand of the king\\'s daughter was, that if he complied, it\\nmight cause him annoyance; if he refused, it might make Cambyses his\\nenemy. When the message came, Amasis, who much dreaded the power of\\nthe Persians, was greatly perplexed whether to give his daughter or\\nno; for that Cambyses did not intend to make her his wife, but would\\nonly receive her as his concubine, he knew for certain. He therefore\\ncast the matter in his mind, and finally resolved what he would do.\\nThere was a daughter of the late king Apries, named Nitetis, a tall\\nand beautiful woman, the last survivor of that royal house. Amasis\\ntook this woman, and decking her out with gold and costly garments,\\nsent her to Persia as if she had been his own child. Some time afterwards,\\nCambyses, as he gave her an embrace, happened to call her by her father\\'s\\nname, whereupon she said to him, \"I see, O king, thou knowest not\\nhow thou has been cheated by Amasis; who took me, and, tricking me\\nout with gauds, sent me to thee as his own daughter. But I am in truth\\nthe child of Apries, who was his lord and master, until he rebelled\\nagainst him, together with the rest of the Egyptians, and put him\\nto death.\" It was this speech, and the cause of quarrel it disclosed,\\nwhich roused the anger of Cambyses, son of Cyrus, and brought his\\narms upon Egypt. Such is the Persian story. \\n\\nThe Egyptians, however, claim Cambyses as belonging to them, declaring\\nthat he was the son of this Nitetis. It was Cyrus, they say, and not\\nCambyses, who sent to Amasis for his daughter. But here they mis-state\\nthe truth. Acquainted as they are beyond all other men with the laws\\nand customs of the Persians, they cannot but be well aware, first,\\nthat it is not the Persian wont to allow a bastard to reign when there\\nis a legitimate heir; and next, that Cambyses was the son of Cassandane,\\nthe daughter of Pharnaspes, an Achaemenian, and not of this Egyptian.\\nBut the fact is that they pervert history in order to claim relationship\\nwith the house of Cyrus. Such is the truth of this matter.\\n\\nI have also heard another account, which I do not at all believe:\\nthat a Persian lady came to visit the wives of Cyrus, and seeing how\\ntall and beautiful were the children of Cassandane, then standing\\nby, broke out into loud praise of them, and admired them exceedingly.\\nBut Cassandane, wife of Cyrus, answered, \"Though such the children\\nI have borne him, yet Cyrus slights me and gives all his regard to\\nthe new-comer from Egypt.\" Thus did she express her vexation on account\\nof Nitetis: whereupon Cambyses, the eldest of her boys, exclaimed,\\n\"Mother, when I am a man, I will turn Egypt upside down for you.\"\\nHe was but ten years old, as the tale runs, when he said this, and\\nastonished all the women, yet he never forgot it afterwards; and on\\nthis account, they say, when he came to be a man, and mounted the\\nthrone, he made his expedition against Egypt. \\n\\nThere was another matter, quite distinct, which helped to bring about\\nthe expedition. One of the mercenaries of Amasis, a Halicarnassian,\\nPhanes by name, a man of good judgment, and a brave warrior, dissatisfied\\nfor some reason or other with his master, deserted the service, and\\ntaking ship, fled to Cambyses, wishing to get speech with him. As\\nhe was a person of no small account among the mercenaries, and one\\nwho could give very exact intelligence about Egypt, Amasis, anxious\\nto recover him, ordered that he should be pursued. He gave the matter\\nin charge to one of the most trusty of the eunuchs, who went in quest\\nof the Halicarnassian in a vessel of war. The eunuch caught him in\\nLycia, but did not contrive to bring him back to Egypt, for Phanes\\noutwitted him by making his guards drunk, and then escaping into Persia.\\nNow it happened that Cambyses was meditating his attack on Egypt,\\nand doubting how he might best pass the desert, when Phanes arrived,\\nand not only told him all the secrets of Amasis, but advised him also\\nhow the desert might be crossed. He counselled him to send an ambassador\\nto the king of the Arabs, and ask him for safe-conduct through the\\nregion. \\n\\nNow the only entrance into Egypt is by this desert: the country from\\nPhoenicia to the borders of the city Cadytis belongs to the people\\ncalled the Palaestine Syrians; from Cadytis, which it appears to me\\nis a city almost as large as Sardis, the marts upon the coast till\\nyou reach Jenysus are the Arabian king\\'s; after Jenysus the Syrians\\nagain come in, and extend to Lake Serbonis, near the place where Mount\\nCasius juts out into the sea. At Lake Serbonis, where the tale goes\\nthat Typhon hid himself, Egypt begins. Now the whole tract between\\nJenysus on the one side, and Lake Serbonis and Mount Casius on the\\nother, and this is no small space, being as much as three days\\' journey,\\nis a dry desert without a drop of water. \\n\\nI shall now mention a thing of which few of those who sail to Egypt\\nare aware. Twice a year wine is brought into Egypt from every part\\nof Greece, as well as from Phoenicia, in earthen jars; and yet in\\nthe whole country you will nowhere see, as I may say, a single jar.\\nWhat then, every one will ask, becomes of the jars? This, too, I will\\nclear up. The burgomaster of each town has to collect the wine-jars\\nwithin his district, and to carry them to Memphis, where they are\\nall filled with water by the Memphians, who then convey them to this\\ndesert tract of Syria. And so it comes to pass that all the jars which\\nenter Egypt year by year, and are there put up to sale, find their\\nway into Syria, whither all the old jars have gone before them.\\n\\nThis way of keeping the passage into Egypt fit for use by storing\\nwater there, was begun by the Persians so soon as they became masters\\nof that country. As, however, at the time of which we speak the tract\\nhad not yet been so supplied, Cambyses took the advice of his Halicarnassian\\nguest, and sent messengers to the Arabian to beg a safe-conduct through\\nthe region. The Arabian granted his prayer, and each pledged faith\\nto the other. \\n\\nThe Arabs keep such pledges more religiously than almost any other\\npeople. They plight faith with the forms following. When two men would\\nswear a friendship, they stand on each side of a third: he with a\\nsharp stone makes a cut on the inside of the hand of each near the\\nmiddle finger, and, taking a piece from their dress, dips it in the\\nblood of each, and moistens therewith seven stones lying in the midst,\\ncalling the while on Bacchus and Urania. After this, the man who makes\\nthe pledge commends the stranger (or the citizen, if citizen he be)\\nto all his friends, and they deem themselves bound to stand to the\\nengagement. They have but these two gods, to wit, Bacchus and Urania;\\nand they say that in their mode of cutting the hair, they follow Bacchus.\\nNow their practice is to cut it in a ring, away from the temples.\\nBacchus they call in their language Orotal, and Urania, Alilat.\\n\\nWhen therefore the Arabian had pledged his faith to the messengers\\nof Cambyses, he straightway contrived as follows:- he filled a number\\nof camels\\' skins with water, and loading therewith all the live camels\\nthat he possessed, drove them into the desert, and awaited the coming\\nof the army. This is the more likely of the two tales that are told.\\nThe other is an improbable story, but, as it is related, I think that\\nI ought not to pass it by. There is a great river in Arabia, called\\nthe Corys, which empties itself into the Erythraean sea. The Arabian\\nking, they say, made a pipe of the skins of oxen and other beasts,\\nreaching from this river all the way to the desert, and so brought\\nthe water to certain cisterns which he had dug in the desert to receive\\nit. It is a twelve days\\' journey from the river to this desert tract.\\nAnd the water, they say, was brought through three different pipes\\nto three separate places. \\n\\nPsammenitus, son of Amasis, lay encamped at the mouth of the. Nile,\\ncalled the Pelusiac, awaiting Cambyses. For Cambyses, when he went\\nup against Egypt, found Amasis no longer in life: he had died after\\nruling Egypt forty and four years, during all which time no great\\nmisfortune had befallen him. When he died, his body was embalmed,\\nand buried in the tomb which he had himself caused to be made in the\\ntemple. After his son Psammenitus had mounted the throne, a strange\\nprodigy occurred in Egypt- rain fell at Egyptian Thebes, a thing which\\nnever happened before, and which, to the present time, has never happened\\nagain, as the Thebans themselves testify. In Upper Egypt it does not\\nusually rain at all; but on this occasion, rain fell at Thebes in\\nsmall drops. \\n\\nThe Persians crossed the desert, and, pitching their camp close to\\nthe Egyptians, made ready for battle. Hereupon the mercenaries in\\nthe pay of Psammenitus, who were Greeks and Carians, full of anger\\nagainst Phanes for having brought a foreign army upon Egypt, bethought\\nthemselves of a mode whereby they might be revenged on him. Phanes\\nhad left sons in Egypt. The mercenaries took these, and leading them\\nto the camp, displayed them before the eyes of their father; after\\nwhich they brought out a bowl, and, placing it in the space between\\nthe two hosts, they led the sons of Phanes, one by one, to the vessel,\\nand slew them over it. When the last was dead, water and wine were\\npoured into the bowl, and all the soldiers tasted of the blood, and\\nso they went to the battle. Stubborn was the fight which followed,\\nand it was not till vast numbers had been slain upon both sides, that\\nthe Egyptians turned and fled. \\n\\nOn the field where this battle was fought I saw a very wonderful thing\\nwhich the natives pointed out to me. The bones of the slain lie scattered\\nupon the field in two lots, those of the Persians in one place by\\nthemselves, as the bodies lay at the first- those of the Egyptians\\nin another place apart from them. If, then, you strike the Persian\\nskulls, even with a pebble, they are so weak, that you break a hole\\nin them; but the Egyptian skulls are so strong, that you may smite\\nthem with a stone and you will scarcely break them in. They gave me\\nthe following reason for this difference, which seemed to me likely\\nenough:- The Egyptians (they said) from early childhood have the head\\nshaved, and so by the action of the sun the skull becomes thick and\\nhard. The same cause prevents baldness in Egypt, where you see fewer\\nbald men than in any other land. Such, then, is the reason why the\\nskulls of the Egyptians are so strong. The Persians, on the other\\nhand, have feeble skulls, because they keep themselves shaded from\\nthe first, wearing turbans upon their heads. What I have here mentioned\\nI saw with my own eyes, and I observed also the like at Papremis,\\nin the case of the Persians who were killed with Achaeamenes, the\\nson of Darius, by Inarus the Libyan. \\n\\nThe Egyptians who fought in the battle, no sooner turned their backs\\nupon the enemy, than they fled away in complete disorder to Memphis,\\nwhere they shut themselves up within the walls. Hereupon Cambyses\\nsent a Mytilenaean vessel, with a Persian herald on board, who was\\nto sail up the Nile to Memphis, and invite the Egyptians to a surrender.\\nThey, however, when they saw the vessel entering the town, poured\\nforth in crowds from the castle, destroyed the ship, and, tearing\\nthe crew limb from limb, so bore them into the fortress. After this\\nMemphis was besieged, and in due time surrendered. Hereon the Libyans\\nwho bordered upon Egypt, fearing the fate of that country, gave themselves\\nup to Cambyses without a battle, made an agreement to pay tribute\\nto him, and forthwith sent him gifts. The Cyrenaeans too, and the\\nBarcaeans, having the same fear as the Libyans, immediately did the\\nlike. Cambyses received the Libyan presents very graciously, but not\\nso the gifts of the Cyrenaeans. They had sent no more than five hundred\\nminx of silver, which Cambyses, I imagine, thought too little. He\\ntherefore snatched the money from them, and with his own hands scattered\\nit among his soldiers. \\n\\nTen days after the fort had fallen, Cambyses resolved to try the spirit\\nof Psammenitus, the Egyptian king, whose whole reign had been but\\nsix months. He therefore had him set in one of the suburbs, and many\\nother Egyptians with him, and there subjected him to insult. First\\nof all he sent his daughter out from the city, clothed in the garb\\nof a slave, with a pitcher to draw water. Many virgins, the daughters\\nof the chief nobles, accompanied her, wearing the same dress. When\\nthe damsels came opposite the place where their fathers sate, shedding\\ntears and uttering cries of woe, the fathers, all but Psammenitus,\\nwept and wailed in return, grieving to see their children in so sad\\na plight; but he, when he had looked and seen, bent his head towards\\nthe ground. In this way passed by the water-carriers. Next to them\\ncame Psammenitus\\' son, and two thousand Egyptians of the same age\\nwith him- all of them having ropes round their necks and bridles in\\ntheir mouths- and they too passed by on their way to suffer death\\nfor the murder of the Mytilenaeans who were destroyed, with their\\nvessel, in Memphis. For so had the royal judges given their sentence\\nfor each Mytilenaean ten of the noblest Egyptians must forfeit life.\"\\nKing Psammenitus saw the train pass on, and knew his son was being\\nled to death, but while the other Egyptians who sate around him wept\\nand were sorely troubled, he showed no further sign than when he saw\\nhis daughter. And now, when they too were gone, it chanced that one\\nof his former boon-companions, a man advanced in years, who had been\\nstripped of all that he had and was a beggar, came where Psammenitus,\\nson of Amasis, and the rest of the Egyptians were, asking alms from\\nthe soldiers. At this sight the king burst into tears, and weeping\\nout aloud, called his friend by his name, and smote himself on the\\nhead. Now there were some who had been set to watch Psammenitus and\\nsee what he would do as each train went by; so these persons went\\nand told Cambyses of his behaviour. Then he, astonished at what was\\ndone, sent a messenger to Psammenitus, and questioned him, saying,\\n\"Psammenitus, thy lord Cambyses asketh thee why, when thou sawest\\nthy daughter brought to shame, and thy son on his way to death, thou\\ndidst neither utter cry nor shed tear, while to a beggar, who is,\\nhe hears, a stranger to thy race, thou gavest those marks of honour.\"\\nTo this question Psammenitus made answer, \"O son of Cyrus, my own\\nmisfortunes were too great for tears; but the woe of my friend deserved\\nthem. When a man falls from splendour and plenty into beggary at the\\nthreshold of old age, one may well weep for him.\" When the messenger\\nbrought back this answer, Cambyses owned it was just; Croesus, likewise,\\nthe Egyptians say, burst into tears- for he too had come into Egypt\\nwith Cambyses- and the Persians who were present wept. Even Cambyses\\nhimself was touched with pity, and he forthwith gave an order that\\nthe son of Psammenitus should be spared from the number of those appointed\\nto die, and Psammenitus himself brought from the suburb into his presence.\\n\\nThe messengers were too late to save the life of Psammenitus\\' son,\\nwho had been cut in pieces the first of all; but they took Psammenitus\\nhimself and brought him before the king. Cambyses allowed him to live\\nwith him, and gave him no more harsh treatment; nay, could he have\\nkept from intermeddling with affairs, he might have recovered Egypt,\\nand ruled it as governor. For the Persian wont is to treat the sons\\nof kings with honour, and even to give their fathers\\' kingdoms to\\nthe children of such as revolt from them. There are many cases from\\nwhich one may collect that this is the Persian rule, and especially\\nthose of Pausiris and Thannyras. Thannyras was son of Inarus the Libyan,\\nand was allowed to succeed his father, as was also Pausiris, son of\\nAmyrtaeus; yet certainly no two persons ever did the Persians more\\ndamage than Amyrtaeus and Inarus. In this case Psammenitus plotted\\nevil, and received his reward accordingly. He was discovered to be\\nstirring up revolt in Egypt, wherefore Cambyses, when his guilt clearly\\nappeared, compelled him to drink bull\\'s blood, which presently caused\\nhis death. Such was the end of Psammenitus. \\n\\nAfter this Cambyses left Memphis, and went to Sais, wishing to do\\nthat which he actually did on his arrival there. He entered the palace\\nof Amasis, and straightway commanded that the body of the king should\\nbe brought forth from the sepulchre. When the attendants did according\\nto his commandment, he further bade them scourge the body, and prick\\nit with goads, and pluck the hair from it, and heap upon it all manner\\nof insults. The body, however, having been embalmed, resisted, and\\nrefused to come apart, do what they would to it; so the attendants\\ngrew weary of their work; whereupon Cambyses bade them take the corpse\\nand burn it. This was truly an impious command to give, for the Persians\\nhold fire to be a god, and never by any chance burn their dead. Indeed\\nthis practice is unlawful, both with them and with the Egyptians-\\nwith them for the reason above mentioned, since they deem it wrong\\nto give the corpse of a man to a god; and with the Egyptians, because\\nthey believe fire to be a live animal, which eats whatever it can\\nseize, and then, glutted with the food, dies with the matter which\\nit feeds upon. Now to give a man\\'s body to be devoured by beasts is\\nin no wise agreeable to their customs, and indeed this is the very\\nreason why they embalm their dead; namely, to prevent them from being\\neaten in the grave by worms. Thus Cambyses commanded what both nations\\naccounted unlawful. According to the Egyptians, it was not Amasis\\nwho was thus treated, but another of their nation who was of about\\nthe same height. The Persians, believing this man\\'s body to be the\\nking\\'s, abused it in the fashion described above. Amasis, they say,\\nwas warned by an oracle of what would happen to him after his death:\\nin order, therefore, to prevent the impending fate, he buried the\\nbody, which afterwards received the blows, inside his own tomb near\\nthe entrance, commanding his son to bury him, when he died, in the\\nfurthest recess of the same sepulchre. For my own part I do not believe\\nthat these orders were ever given by Amasis; the Egyptians, as it\\nseems to me, falsely assert it, to save their own dignity.\\n\\nAfter this Cambyses took counsel with himself, and planned three expeditions.\\nOne was against the Carthaginians, another against the Ammonians,\\nand a third against the long-lived Ethiopians, who dwelt in that part\\nof Libya which borders upon the southern sea. He judged it best to\\ndespatch his fleet against Carthage and to send some portion of his\\nland army to act against the Ammonians, while his spies went into\\nEthiopia, under the pretence of carrying presents to the king, but\\nin reality to take note of all they saw, and especially to observe\\nwhether there was really what is called \"the table of the Sun\" in\\nEthiopia. \\n\\nNow the table of the Sun according to the accounts given of it may\\nbe thus described:- It is a meadow in the skirts of their city full\\nof the boiled flesh of all manner of beasts, which the magistrates\\nare careful to store with meat every night, and where whoever likes\\nmay come and eat during the day. The people of the land say that the\\nearth itself brings forth the food. Such is the description which\\nis given of this table. \\n\\nWhen Cambyses had made up his mind that the spies should go, he forthwith\\nsent to Elephantine for certain of the Icthyophagi who were acquainted\\nwith the Ethiopian tongue; and, while they were being fetched, issued\\norders to his fleet to sail against Carthage. But the Phoenicians\\nsaid they would not go, since they were bound to the Carthaginians\\nby solemn oaths, and since besides it would be wicked in them to make\\nwar on their own children. Now when the Phoenicians refused, the rest\\nof the fleet was unequal to the undertaking; and so it was that the\\nCarthaginians escaped, and were not enslaved by the Persians. Cambyses\\nthought it not right to force the war upon the Phoenicians, because\\nthey had yielded themselves to the Persians, and because upon the\\nPhoenicians all his sea-service depended. The Cyprians had also joined\\nthe Persians of their own accord, and took part with them in the expedition\\nagainst Egypt. \\n\\nAs soon as the Icthyophagi arrived from Elephantine, Cambyses, having\\ntold them what they were to say, forthwith despatched them into Ethiopia\\nwith these following gifts: to wit, a purple robe, a gold chain for\\nthe neck, armlets, an alabaster box of myrrh, and a cask of palm wine.\\nThe Ethiopians to whom this embassy was sent are said to be the tallest\\nand handsomest men in the whole world. In their customs they differ\\ngreatly from the rest of mankind, and particularly in the way they\\nchoose their kings; for they find out the man who is the tallest of\\nall the citizens, and of strength equal to his height, and appoint\\nhim to rule over them. \\n\\nThe Icthyophagi on reaching this people, delivered the gifts to the\\nking of the country, and spoke as follows:- \"Cambyses, king of the\\nPersians, anxious to become thy ally and sworn friend, has sent us\\nto hold converse with thee, and to bear thee the gifts thou seest,\\nwhich are the things wherein he himself delights the most.\" Hereon\\nthe Ethiopian, who knew they came as spies, made answer:- \"The king\\nof the Persians sent you not with these gifts because he much desired\\nto become my sworn friend- nor is the account which ye give of yourselves\\ntrue, for ye are come to search out my kingdom. Also your king is\\nnot a just man- for were he so, he had not coveted a land which is\\nnot his own, nor brought slavery on a people who never did him any\\nwrong. Bear him this bow, and say- \\'The king of the Ethiops thus advises\\nthe king of the Persians when the Persians can pull a bow of this\\nstrength thus easily, then let him come with an army of superior strength\\nagainst the long-lived Ethiopians- till then, let him thank the gods\\nthat they have not put it into the heart of the sons of the Ethiops\\nto covet countries which do not belong to them.\\' \\n\\nSo speaking, he unstrung the bow, and gave it into the hands of the\\nmessengers. Then, taking the purple robe, he asked them what it was,\\nand how it had been made. They answered truly, telling him concerning\\nthe purple, and the art of the dyer- whereat he observed \"that the\\nmen were deceitful, and their garments also.\" Next he took the neck-chain\\nand the armlets, and asked about them. So the Icthyophagi explained\\ntheir use as ornaments. Then the king laughed, and fancying they were\\nfetters, said, \"the Ethiopians had much stronger ones.\" Thirdly, he\\ninquired about the myrrh, and when they told him how it was made and\\nrubbed upon the limbs, he said the same as he had said about the robe.\\nLast of all he came to the wine, and having learnt their way of making\\nit, he drank a draught, which greatly delighted him; whereupon he\\nasked what the Persian king was wont to eat, and to what age the longest-lived\\nof the Persians had been known to attain. They told him that the king\\nate bread, and described the nature of wheat- adding that eighty years\\nwas the longest term of man\\'s life among the Persians. Hereat he remarked,\\n\"It did not surprise him, if they fed on dirt, that they died so soon;\\nindeed he was sure they never would have lived so long as eighty years,\\nexcept for the refreshment they got from that drink (meaning the wine),\\nwherein he confessed the Persians surpassed the Ethiopians.\"\\n\\nThe Icthyophagi then in their turn questioned the king concerning\\nthe term of life, and diet of his people, and were told that most\\nof them lived to be a hundred and twenty years old, while some even\\nwent beyond that age- they ate boiled flesh, and had for their drink\\nnothing but milk. When the Icthyophagi showed wonder at the number\\nof the years, he led them to a fountain, wherein when they had washed,\\nthey found their flesh all glossy and sleek, as if they had bathed\\nin oil- and a scent came from the spring like that of violets. The\\nwater was so weak, they said, that nothing would float in it, neither\\nwood, nor any lighter substance, but all went to the bottom. If the\\naccount of this fountain be true, it would be their constant use of\\nthe water from it which makes them so long-lived. When they quitted\\nthe fountain the king led them to a prison, where the prisoners were\\nall of them bound with fetters of gold. Among these Ethiopians copper\\nis of all metals the most scarce and valuable. After they had seen\\nthe prison, they were likewise shown what is called \"the table of\\nthe Sun.\" \\n\\nAlso, last of all, they were allowed to behold the coffins of the\\nEthiopians, which are made (according to report) of crystal, after\\nthe following fashion:- When the dead body has been dried, either\\nin the Egyptian, or in some other manner, they cover the whole with\\ngypsum, and adorn it with painting until it is as like the living\\nman as possible. Then they place the body in a crystal pillar which\\nhas been hollowed out to receive it, crystal being dug up in great\\nabundance in their country, and of a kind very easy to work. You may\\nsee the corpse through the pillar within which it lies; and it neither\\ngives out any unpleasant odour, nor is it in any respect unseemly;\\nyet there is no part that is not as plainly visible as if the body\\nwere bare. The next of kin keep the crystal pillar in their houses\\nfor a full year from the time of the death, and give it the first\\nfruits continually, and honour it with sacrifice. After the year is\\nout they bear the pillar forth, and set it up near the town.\\n\\nWhen the spies had now seen everything, they returned back to Egypt,\\nand made report to Cambyses, who was stirred to anger by their words.\\nForthwith he set out on his march against the Ethiopians without having\\nmade any provision for the sustenance of his army, or reflected that\\nhe was about to wage war in the uttermost parts of the earth. Like\\na senseless madman as he was, no sooner did he receive the report\\nof the Icthyophagi than he began his march, bidding the Greeks who\\nwere with his army remain where they were, and taking only his land\\nforce with him. At Thebes, which he passed through on his way, he\\ndetached from his main body some fifty thousand men, and sent them\\nagainst the Ammonians with orders to carry the people into captivity,\\nand burn the oracle of Jupiter. Meanwhile he himself went on with\\nthe rest of his forces against the Ethiopians. Before, however, he\\nhad accomplished one-fifth part of the distance, all that the army\\nhad in the way of provisions failed; whereupon the men began to eat\\nthe sumpter beasts, which shortly failed also. If then, at this time,\\nCambyses, seeing what was happening, had confessed himself in the\\nwrong, and led his army back, he would have done the wisest thing\\nthat he could after the mistake made at the outset; but as it was,\\nhe took no manner of heed, but continued to march forwards. So long\\nas the earth gave them anything, the soldiers sustained life by eating\\nthe grass and herbs; but when they came to the bare sand, a portion\\nof them were guilty of a horrid deed: by tens they cast lots for a\\nman, who was slain to be the food of the others. When Cambyses heard\\nof these doings, alarmed at such cannibalism, he gave up his attack\\non Ethiopia, and retreating by the way he had come, reached Thebes,\\nafter he had lost vast numbers of his soldiers. From Thebes he marched\\ndown to Memphis, where he dismissed the Greeks, allowing them to sail\\nhome. And so ended the expedition against Ethiopia. \\n\\nThe men sent to attack the Ammonians, started from Thebes, having\\nguides with them, and may be clearly traced as far as the city Oasis,\\nwhich is inhabited by Samians, said to be of the tribe Aeschrionia.\\nThe place is distant from Thebes seven days\\' journey across the sand,\\nand is called in our tongue \"the Island of the Blessed.\" Thus far\\nthe army is known to have made its way; but thenceforth nothing is\\nto be heard of them, except what the Ammonians, and those who get\\ntheir knowledge from them, report. It is certain they neither reached\\nthe Ammonians, nor even came back to Egypt. Further than this, the\\nAmmonians relate as follows:- That the Persians set forth from Oasis\\nacross the sand, and had reached about half way between that place\\nand themselves when, as they were at their midday meal, a wind arose\\nfrom the south, strong and deadly, bringing with it vast columns of\\nwhirling sand, which entirely covered up the troops and caused them\\nwholly to disappear. Thus, according to the Ammonians, did it fare\\nwith this army. \\n\\nAbout the time when Cambyses arrived at Memphis, Apis appeared to\\nthe Egyptians. Now Apis is the god whom the Greeks call Epaphus. As\\nsoon as he appeared, straightway all the Egyptians arrayed themselves\\nin their gayest garments, and fell to feasting and jollity: which\\nwhen Cambyses saw, making sure that these rejoicings were on account\\nof his own ill success, he called before him the officers who had\\ncharge of Memphis, and demanded of them- \"Why, when he was in Memphis\\nbefore, the Egyptians had done nothing of this kind, but waited until\\nnow, when he had returned with the loss of so many of his troops?\"\\nThe officers made answer, \"That one of their gods had appeared to\\nthem, a god who at long intervals of time had been accustomed to show\\nhimself in Egypt- and that always on his appearance the whole of Egypt\\nfeasted and kept jubilee.\" When Cambyses heard this, he told them\\nthat they lied, and as liars he condemned them all to suffer death.\\n\\nWhen they were dead, he called the priests to his presence, and questioning\\nthem received the same answer; whereupon he observed, \"That he would\\nsoon know whether a tame god had really come to dwell in Egypt\"- and\\nstraightway, without another word, he bade them bring Apis to him.\\nSo they went out from his presence to fetch the god. Now this Apis,\\nor Epaphus, is the calf of a cow which is never afterwards able to\\nbear young. The Egyptians say that fire comes down from heaven upon\\nthe cow, which thereupon conceives Apis. The calf which is so called\\nhas the following marks:- He is black, with a square spot of white\\nupon his forehead, and on his back the figure of an eagle; the hairs\\nin his tail are double, and there is a beetle upon his tongue.\\n\\nWhen the priests returned bringing Apis with them, Cambyses, like\\nthe harebrained person that he was, drew his dagger, and aimed at\\nthe belly of the animal, but missed his mark, and stabbed him in the\\nthigh. Then he laughed, and said thus to the priests:- \"Oh! blockheads,\\nand think ye that gods become like this, of flesh and blood, and sensible\\nto steel? A fit god indeed for Egyptians, such an one! But it shall\\ncost you dear that you have made me your laughing-stock.\" When he\\nhad so spoken, he ordered those whose business it was to scourge the\\npriests, and if they found any of the Egyptians keeping festival to\\nput them to death. Thus was the feast stopped throughout the land\\nof Egypt, and the priests suffered punishment. Apis, wounded in the\\nthigh, lay some time pining in the temple; at last he died of his\\nwound, and the priests buried him secretly without the knowledge of\\nCambyses. \\n\\nAnd now Cambyses, who even before had not been quite in his right\\nmind, was forthwith, as the Egyptians say, smitten with madness for\\nthis crime. The first of his outrages was the slaying of Smerdis,\\nhis full brother, whom he had sent back to Persia from Egypt out of\\nenvy, because he drew the bow brought from the Ethiopians by the Icthyophagi\\n(which none of the other Persians were able to bend) the distance\\nof two fingers\\' breadth. When Smerdis was departed into Persia, Cambyses\\nhad a vision in his sleep- he thought a messenger from Persia came\\nto him with tidings that Smerdis sat upon the royal throne and with\\nhis head touched the heavens. Fearing therefore for himself, and thinking\\nit likely that his brother would kill him and rule in his stead, Cambyses\\nsent into Persia Prexaspes, whom he trusted beyond all the other Persians,\\nbidding him put Smerdis to death. So this Prexaspes went up to Susa\\nand slew Smerdis. Some say he killed him as they hunted together,\\nothers, that he took him down to the Erythraean Sea, and there drowned\\nhim. \\n\\nThis, it is said, was the first outrage which Cambyses committed.\\nThe second was the slaying of his sister, who had accompanied him\\ninto Egypt, and lived with him as his wife, though she was his full\\nsister, the daughter both of his father and his mother. The way wherein\\nhe had made her his wife was the following:-It was not the custom\\nof the Persians, before his time, to marry their sisters, but Cambyses,\\nhappening to fall in love with one of his and wishing to take her\\nto wife, as he knew that it was an uncommon thing, called together\\nthe royal judges, and put it to them, \"whether there was any law which\\nallowed a brother, if he wished, to marry his sister?\" Now the royal\\njudges are certain picked men among the Persians, who hold their office\\nfor life, or until they are found guilty of some misconduct. By them\\njustice is administered in Persia, and they are the interpreters of\\nthe old laws, all disputes being referred to their decision. When\\nCambyses, therefore, put his question to these judges, they gave him\\nan answer which was at once true and safe- \"they did not find any\\nlaw,\" they said, \"allowing a brother to take his sister to wife, but\\nthey found a law, that the king of the Persians might do whatever\\nhe pleased.\" And so they neither warped the law through fear of Cambyses,\\nnor ruined themselves by over stiffly maintaining the law; but they\\nbrought another quite distinct law to the king\\'s help, which allowed\\nhim to have his wish. Cambyses, therefore, married the object of his\\nlove, and no long time afterwards he took to wife another sister.\\nIt was the younger of these who went with him into Egypt, and there\\nsuffered death at his hands. \\n\\nConcerning the manner of her death, as concerning that of Smerdis,\\ntwo different accounts are given. The story which the Greeks tell\\nis that Cambyses had set a young dog to fight the cub of a lioness-\\nhis wife looking on at the time. Now the dog was getting the worse,\\nwhen a pup of the same litter broke his chain, and came to his brother\\'s\\naid- then the two dogs together fought the lion, and conquered him.\\nThe thing greatly pleased Cambyses, but his sister who was sitting\\nby shed tears. When Cambyses saw this, he asked her why she wept:\\nwhereon she told him, that seeing the young dog come to his brother\\'s\\naid made her think of Smerdis, whom there was none to help. For this\\nspeech, the Greeks say, Cambyses put her to death. But the Egyptians\\ntell the story thus:- The two were sitting at table, when the sister\\ntook a lettuce, and stripping the leaves off, asked her brother \"when\\nhe thought the lettuce looked the prettiest- when it had all its leaves\\non, or now that it was stripped?\" He answered, \"When the leaves were\\non.\" \"But thou,\" she rejoined, \"hast done as I did to the lettuce,\\nand made bare the house of Cyrus.\" Then Cambyses was wroth, and sprang\\nfiercely upon her, though she was with child at the time. And so it\\ncame to pass that she miscarried and died. \\n\\nThus mad was Cambyses upon his own kindred, and this either from his\\nusage of Apis, or from some other among the many causes from which\\ncalamities are wont to arise. They say that from his birth he was\\nafflicted with a dreadful disease, the disorder which some call \"the\\nsacred sickness.\" It would be by no means strange, therefore, if his\\nmind were affected in some degree, seeing that his body laboured under\\nso sore a malady. \\n\\nHe was mad also upon others besides his kindred; among the rest, upon\\nPrexaspes, the man whom he esteemed beyond all the rest of the Persians,\\nwho carried his messages, and whose son held the office- an honour\\nof no small account in Persia- of his cupbearer. Him Cambyses is said\\nto have once addressed as follows:- \"What sort of man, Prexaspes,\\ndo the Persians think me? What do they say of me?\" Prexaspes answered,\\n\"Oh! sire, they praise thee greatly in all things but one- they say\\nthou art too much given to love of wine.\" Such Prexaspes told him\\nwas the judgment of the Persians; whereupon Cambyses, full of rage,\\nmade answer, \"What? they say now that I drink too much wine, and so\\nhave lost my senses, and am gone out of my mind! Then their former\\nspeeches about me were untrue.\" For once, when the Persians were sitting\\nwith him, and Croesus was by, he had asked them, \"What sort of man\\nthey thought him compared to his father Cyrus?\" Hereon they had answered,\\n\"That he surpassed his father, for he was lord of all that his father\\never ruled, and further had made himself master of Egypt, and the\\nsea.\" Then Croesus, who was standing near, and misliked the comparison,\\nspoke thus to Cambyses: \"In my judgment, O son of Cyrus, thou art\\nnot equal to thy father, for thou hast not yet left behind thee such\\na son as he.\" Cambyses was delighted when he heard this reply, and\\npraised the judgment of Croesus. \\n\\nRecollecting these answers, Cambyses spoke fiercely to Prexaspes,\\nsaying, \"Judge now thyself, Prexaspes, whether the Persians tell the\\ntruth, or whether it is not they who are mad for speaking as they\\ndo. Look there now at thy son standing in the vestibule- if I shoot\\nand hit him right in the middle of the heart, it will be plain the\\nPersians have no grounds for what they say: if I miss him, then I\\nallow that the Persians are right, and that I am out of my mind.\"\\nSo speaking he drew his bow to the full, and struck the boy, who straightway\\nfell down dead. Then Cambyses ordered the body to be opened, and the\\nwound examined; and when the arrow was found to have entered the heart,\\nthe king was quite overjoyed, and said to the father with a laugh,\\n\"Now thou seest plainly, Prexaspes, that it is not I who am mad, but\\nthe Persians who have lost their senses. I pray thee tell me, sawest\\nthou ever mortal man send an arrow with a better aim?\" Prexaspes,\\nseeing that the king was not in his right mind, and fearing for himself,\\nreplied, \"Oh! my lord, I do not think that God himself could shoot\\nso dexterously.\" Such was the outrage which Cambyses committed at\\nthis time: at another, he took twelve of the noblest Persians, and,\\nwithout bringing any charge worthy of death against them, buried them\\nall up to the neck. \\n\\nHereupon Croesus the Lydian thought it right to admonish Cambyses,\\nwhich he did in these words following:- \"Oh! king, allow not thyself\\nto give way entirely to thy youth, and the heat of thy temper, but\\ncheck and control thyself. It is well to look to consequences, and\\nin forethought is true wisdom. Thou layest hold of men, who are thy\\nfellow-citizens, and, without cause of complaint, slayest them- thou\\neven puttest children to death- bethink thee now, if thou shalt often\\ndo things like these, will not the Persians rise in revolt against\\nthee? It is by thy father\\'s wish that I offer thee advice; he charged\\nme strictly to give thee such counsel as I might see to be most for\\nthy good.\" In thus advising Cambyses, Croesus meant nothing but what\\nwas friendly. But Cambyses answered him, \"Dost thou presume to offer\\nme advice? Right well thou ruledst thy own country when thou wert\\na king, and right sage advice thou gavest my father Cyrus, bidding\\nhim cross the Araxes and fight the Massagetae in their own land, when\\nthey were willing to have passed over into ours. By thy misdirection\\nof thine own affairs thou broughtest ruin upon thyself, and by thy\\nbad counsel, which he followed, thou broughtest ruin upon Cyrus, my\\nfather. But thou shalt not escape punishment now, for I have long\\nbeen seeking to find some occasion against thee.\" As he thus spoke,\\nCambyses took up his bow to shoot at Croesus; but Croesus ran hastily\\nout, and escaped. So when Cambyses found that he could not kill him\\nwith his bow, he bade his servants seize him, and put him to death.\\nThe servants, however, who knew their master\\'s humour, thought it\\nbest to hide Croesus; that so, if Cambyses relented, and asked for\\nhim, they might bring him out, and get a reward for having saved his\\nlife- if, on the other hand, he did not relent, or regret the loss,\\nthey might then despatch him. Not long afterwards, Cambyses did in\\nfact regret the loss of Croesus, and the servants, perceiving it,\\nlet him know that he was still alive. \"I am glad,\" said he, \"that\\nCroesus lives, but as for you who saved him, ye shall not escape my\\nvengeance, but shall all of you be put to death.\" And he did even\\nas he had said. \\n\\nMany other wild outrages of this sort did Cambyses commit, both upon\\nthe Persians and the allies, while he still stayed at Memphis; among\\nthe rest he opened the ancient sepulchres, and examined the bodies\\nthat were buried in them. He likewise went into the temple of Vulcan,\\nand made great sport of the image. For the image of Vulcan is very\\nlike the Pataeci of the Phoenicians, wherewith they ornament the prows\\nof their ships of war. If persons have not seen these, I will explain\\nin a different way- it is a figure resembling that of a pigmy. He\\nwent also into the temple of the Cabiri, which it is unlawful for\\nany one to enter except the priests, and not only made sport of the\\nimages, but even burnt them. They are made like the statue of Vulcan,\\nwho is said to have been their father. \\n\\nThus it appears certain to me, by a great variety of proofs, that\\nCambyses was raving mad; he would not else have set himself to make\\na mock of holy rites and long-established usages. For if one were\\nto offer men to choose out of all the customs in the world such as\\nseemed to them the best, they would examine the whole number, and\\nend by preferring their own; so convinced are they that their own\\nusages far surpass those of all others. Unless, therefore, a man was\\nmad, it is not likely that he would make sport of such matters. That\\npeople have this feeling about their laws may be seen by very many\\nproofs: among others, by the following. Darius, after he had got the\\nkingdom, called into his presence certain Greeks who were at hand,\\nand asked- \"What he should pay them to eat the bodies of their fathers\\nwhen they died?\" To which they answered, that there was no sum that\\nwould tempt them to do such a thing. He then sent for certain Indians,\\nof the race called Callatians, men who eat their fathers, and asked\\nthem, while the Greeks stood by, and knew by the help of an interpreter\\nall that was said - \"What he should give them to burn the bodies of\\ntheir fathers at their decease?\" The Indians exclaimed aloud, and\\nbade him forbear such language. Such is men\\'s wont herein; and Pindar\\nwas right, in my judgment, when he said, \"Law is the king o\\'er all.\"\\n\\nWhile Cambyses was carrying on this war in Egypt, the Lacedaemonians\\nlikewise sent a force to Samos against Polycrates, the son of Aeaces,\\nwho had by insurrection made himself master of that island. At the\\noutset he divided the state into three parts, and shared the kingdom\\nwith his brothers, Pantagnotus and Syloson; but later, having killed\\nthe former and banished the latter, who was the younger of the two,\\nhe held the whole island. Hereupon he made a contract of friendship\\nwith Amasis the Egyptian king, sending him gifts, and receiving from\\nhim others in return. In a little while his power so greatly increased,\\nthat the fame of it went abroad throughout Ionia and the rest of Greece.\\nWherever he turned his arms, success waited on him. He had a fleet\\nof a hundred penteconters, and bowmen to the number of a thousand.\\nHerewith he plundered all, without distinction of friend or foe; for\\nhe argued that a friend was better pleased if you gave him back what\\nyou had taken from him, than if you spared him at the first. He captured\\nmany of the islands, and several towns upon the mainland. Among his\\nother doings he overcame the Lesbians in a sea-fight, when they came\\nwith all their forces to the help of Miletus, and made a number of\\nthem prisoners. These persons, laden with fetters, dug the moat which\\nsurrounds the castle at Samos. \\n\\nThe exceeding good fortune of Polycrates did not escape the notice\\nof Amasis, who was much disturbed thereat. When therefore his successes\\ncontinued increasing, Amasis wrote him the following letter, and sent\\nit to Samos. \"Amasis to Polycrates thus sayeth: It is a pleasure to\\nhear of a friend and ally prospering, but thy exceeding prosperity\\ndoes not cause me joy, forasmuch as I know that the gods are envious.\\nMy wish for myself and for those whom I love is to be now successful,\\nand now to meet with a check; thus passing through life amid alternate\\ngood and ill, rather than with perpetual good fortune. For never yet\\ndid I hear tell of any one succeeding in all his undertakings, who\\ndid not meet with calamity at last, and come to utter ruin. Now, therefore,\\ngive ear to my words, and meet thy good luck in this way: bethink\\nthee which of all thy treasures thou valuest most and canst least\\nbear to part with; take it, whatsoever it be, and throw it away, so\\nthat it may be sure never to come any more into the sight of man.\\nThen, if thy good fortune be not thenceforth chequered with ill, save\\nthyself from harm by again doing as I have counselled.\" \\n\\nWhen Polycrates read this letter, and perceived that the advice of\\nAmasis was good, he considered carefully with himself which of the\\ntreasures that he had in store it would grieve him most to lose. After\\nmuch thought he made up his mind that it was a signet-ring which he\\nwas wont to wear, an emerald set in gold, the workmanship of Theodore,\\nson of Telecles, a Samian. So he determined to throw this away; and,\\nmanning a penteconter, he went on board, and bade the sailors put\\nout into the open sea. When he was now a long way from the island,\\nhe took the ring from his finger, and, in the sight of all those who\\nwere on board, flung it into the deep. This done, he returned home,\\nand gave vent to his sorrow. \\n\\nNow it happened five or six days afterwards that a fisherman caught\\na fish so large and beautiful that he thought it well deserved to\\nbe made a present of to the king. So he took it with him to the gate\\nof the palace, and said that he wanted to see Polycrates. Then Polycrates\\nallowed him to come in, and the fisherman gave him the fish with these\\nwords following- \"Sir king, when I took this prize, I thought I would\\nnot carry it to market, though I am a poor man who live by my trade.\\nI said to myself, it is worthy of Polycrates and his greatness; and\\nso I brought it here to give it to you.\" The speech pleased the king,\\nwho thus spoke in reply:- \"Thou didst right well, friend, and I am\\ndoubly indebted, both for the gift, and for the speech. Come now,\\nand sup with me.\" So the fisherman went home, esteeming it a high\\nhonour that he had been asked to sup with the king. Meanwhile the\\nservants, on cutting open the fish, found the signet of their master\\nin its belly. No sooner did they see it than they seized upon it,\\nand hastening to Polycrates with great joy, restored it to him, and\\ntold him in what way it had been found. The king, who saw something\\nprovidential in the matter, forthwith wrote a letter to Amasis, telling\\nhim all that had happened, what he had himself done, and what had\\nbeen the upshot- and despatched the letter to Egypt. \\n\\nWhen Amasis had read the letter of Polycrates, he perceived that it\\ndoes not belong to man to save his fellow-man from the fate which\\nis in store for him; likewise he felt certain that Polycrates would\\nend ill, as he prospered in everything, even finding what he had thrown\\naway. So he sent a herald to Samos, and dissolved the contract of\\nfriendship. This he did, that when the great and heavy misfortune\\ncame, he might escape the grief which he would have felt if the sufferer\\nhad been his bond-friend. \\n\\nIt was with this Polycrates, so fortunate in every undertaking, that\\nthe Lacedaemonians now went to war. Certain Samians, the same who\\nafterwards founded the city of Cydonia in Crete, had earnestly intreated\\ntheir help. For Polycrates, at the time when Cambyses, son of Cyrus,\\nwas gathering together an armament against Egypt, had sent to beg\\nhim not to omit to ask aid from Samos; whereupon Cambyses with much\\nreadiness despatched a messenger to the island, and made request that\\nPolycrates would give some ships to the naval force which he was collecting\\nagainst Egypt. Polycrates straightway picked out from among the citizens\\nsuch as he thought most likely to stir revolt against him, and manned\\nwith them forty triremes, which he sent to Cambyses, bidding him keep\\nthe men safe, and never allow them to return home. \\n\\nNow some accounts say that these Samians did not reach Egypt; for\\nthat when they were off Carpathus, they took counsel together and\\nresolved to sail no further. But others maintain that they did go\\nto Egypt, and, finding themselves watched, deserted, and sailed back\\nto Samos. There Polycrates went out against them with his fleet, and\\na battle was fought and gained by the exiles; after which they disembarked\\nupon the island and engaged the land forces of Polycrates, but were\\ndefeated, and so sailed off to Lacedaemon. Some relate that the Samians\\nfrom Egypt overcame Polycrates, but it seems to me untruly; for had\\nthe Samians been strong enough to conquer Polycrates by themselves,\\nthey would not have needed to call in the aid of the Lacedaemonians.\\nAnd moreover, it is not likely that a king who had in his pay so large\\na body of foreign mercenaries, and maintained likewise such a force\\nof native bowmen, would have been worsted by an army so small as that\\nof the returned Samians. As for his own subjects, to hinder them from\\nbetraying him and joining the exiles, Polycrates shut up their wives\\nand children in the sheds built to shelter his ships, and was ready\\nto burn sheds and all in case of need. \\n\\nWhen the banished Samians reached Sparta, they had audience of the\\nmagistrates, before whom they made a long speech, as was natural with\\npersons greatly in want of aid. Accordingly at this first sitting\\nthe Spartans answered them that they had forgotten the first half\\nof their speech, and could make nothing of the remainder. Afterwards\\nthe Samians had another audience, whereat they simply said, showing\\na bag which they had brought with them, \"The bag wants flour.\" The\\nSpartans answered that they did not need to have said \"the bag\"; however,\\nthey resolved to give them aid. \\n\\nThen the Lacedaemonians made ready and set forth to the attack of\\nSamos, from a motive of gratitude, if we may believe the Samians,\\nbecause the Samians had once sent ships to their aid against the Messenians;\\nbut as the Spartans themselves say, not so much from any wish to assist\\nthe Samians who begged their help, as from a desire to punish the\\npeople who had seized the bowl which they sent to Croesus, and the\\ncorselet which Amasis, king of Egypt, sent as a present to them. The\\nSamians made prize of this corselet the year before they took the\\nbowl- it was of linen, and had a vast number of figures of animals\\ninwoven into its fabric, and was likewise embroidered with gold and\\ntree-wool. What is most worthy of admiration in it is that each of\\nthe twists, although of fine texture, contains within it three hundred\\nand sixty threads, all of them clearly visible. The corselet which\\nAmasis gave to the temple of Minerva in Lindus is just such another.\\n\\nThe Corinthians likewise right willingly lent a helping hand towards\\nthe expedition against Samos; for a generation earlier, about the\\ntime of the seizure of the wine-bowl, they too had suffered insult\\nat the hands of the Samians. It happened that Periander, son of Cypselus,\\nhad taken three hundred boys, children of the chief nobles among the\\nCorcyraeans, and sent them to Alyattes for eunuchs; the men who had\\nthem in charge touched at Samos on their way to Sardis; whereupon\\nthe Samians, having found out what was to become of the boys when\\nthey reached that city, first prompted them to take sanctuary at the\\ntemple of Diana; and after this, when the Corinthians, as they were\\nforbidden to tear the suppliants from the holy place, sought to cut\\noff from them all supplies of food, invented a festival in their behalf,\\nwhich they celebrate to this day with the selfsame rites. Each evening,\\nas night closed in, during the whole time that the boys continued\\nthere, choirs of youths and virgins were placed about the temple,\\ncarrying in their hands cakes made of sesame and honey, in order that\\nthe Corcyraean boys might snatch the cakes, and so get enough to live\\nupon. \\n\\nAnd this went on for so long, that at last the Corinthians who had\\ncharge of the boys gave them up, and took their departure, upon which\\nthe Samians conveyed them back to Corcyra. If now, after the death\\nof Periander, the Corinthians and Corcyraeans had been good friends,\\nit is not to be imagined that the former would ever have taken part\\nin the expedition against Samos for such a reason as this; but as,\\nin fact, the two people have always, ever since the first settlement\\nof the island, been enemies to one another, this outrage was remembered,\\nand the Corinthians bore the Samians a grudge for it. Periander had\\nchosen the youths from among the first families in Corcyra, and sent\\nthem a present to Alyattes, to avenge a wrong which he had received.\\nFor it was the Corcyraeans who began the quarrel and injured Periander\\nby an outrage of a horrid nature. \\n\\nAfter Periander had put to death his wife Melissa, it chanced that\\non this first affliction a second followed of a different kind. His\\nwife had borne him two sons, and one of them had now reached the age\\nof seventeen, the other of eighteen years, when their mother\\'s father,\\nProcles, tyrant of Epidaurus, asked them to his court. They went,\\nand Procles treated them with much kindness, as was natural, considering\\nthey were his own daughter\\'s children. At length, when the time for\\nparting came, Procles, as he was sending them on their way, said,\\n\"Know you now, my children, who it was that caused your mother\\'s death?\"\\nThe elder son took no account of this speech, but the younger, whose\\nname was Lycophron, was sorely troubled at it- so much so, that when\\nhe got back to Corinth, looking upon his father as his mother\\'s murderer,\\nhe would neither speak to him, nor answer when spoken to, nor utter\\na word in reply to all his questionings. So Periander at last, growing\\nfurious at such behaviour, banished him from his house. \\n\\nThe younger son gone, he turned to the elder and asked him, \"what\\nit was that their grandfather had said to them?\" Then he related in\\nhow kind and friendly a fashion he had received them; but, not having\\ntaken any notice of the speech which Procles had uttered at parting,\\nhe quite forgot to mention it. Periander insisted that it was not\\npossible this should be all- their grandfather must have given them\\nsome hint or other- and he went on pressing him, till at last the\\nlad remembered the parting speech and told it. Periander, after he\\nhad turned the whole matter over in his thoughts, and felt unwilling\\nto give way at all, sent a messenger to the persons who had opened\\ntheir houses to his outcast son, and forbade them to harbour him.\\nThen the boy, when he was chased from one friend, sought refuge with\\nanother, but was driven from shelter to shelter by the threats of\\nhis father, who menaced all those that took him in, and commanded\\nthem to shut their doors against him. Still, as fast as he was forced\\nto leave one house he went to another, and was received by the inmates;\\nfor his acquaintance, although in no small alarm, yet gave him shelter,\\nas he was Periander\\'s son. \\n\\nAt last Periander made proclamation that whoever harboured his son\\nor even spoke to him, should forfeit a certain sum of money to Apollo.\\nOn hearing this no one any longer liked to take him in, or even to\\nhold converse with him, and he himself did not think it right to seek\\nto do what was forbidden; so, abiding by his resolve, he made his\\nlodging in the public porticos. When four days had passed in this\\nway, Periander, secing how wretched his son was, that he neither washed\\nnor took any food, felt moved with compassion towards him; wherefore,\\nforegoing his anger, he approached him, and said, \"Which is better,\\noh! my son, to fare as now thou farest, or to receive my crown and\\nall the good things that I possess, on the one condition of submitting\\nthyself to thy father? See, now, though my own child, and lord of\\nthis wealthy Corinth, thou hast brought thyself to a beggar\\'s life,\\nbecause thou must resist and treat with anger him whom it least behoves\\nthee to oppose. If there has been a calamity, and thou bearest me\\nill will on that account, bethink thee that I too feel it, and am\\nthe greatest sufferer, in as much as it was by me that the deed was\\ndone. For thyself, now that thou knowest how much better a thing it\\nis to be envied than pitied, and how dangerous it is to indulge anger\\nagainst parents and superiors, come back with me to thy home.\" With\\nsuch words as these did Periander chide his son; but the son made\\nno reply, except to remind his father that he was indebted to the\\ngod in the penalty for coming and holding converse with him. Then\\nPeriander knew that there was no cure for the youth\\'s malady, nor\\nmeans of overcoming it; so he prepared a ship and sent him away out\\nof his sight to Corcyra, which island at that time belonged to him.\\nAs for Procles, Periander, regarding him as the true author of all\\nhis present troubles, went to war with him as soon as his son was\\ngone, and not only made himself master of his kingdom Epidaurus, but\\nalso took Procles himself, and carried him into captivity.\\n\\nAs time went on, and Periander came to be old, he found himself no\\nlonger equal to the oversight and management of affairs. Seeing, therefore,\\nin his eldest son no manner of ability, but knowing him to be dull\\nand blockish, he sent to Corcyra and recalled Lycophron to take the\\nkingdom. Lycophron, however, did not even deign to ask the bearer\\nof this message a question. But Periander\\'s heart was set upon the\\nyouth, so he sent again to him, this time by his own daughter, the\\nsister of Lycophron, who would, he thought, have more power to persuade\\nhim than any other person. Then she, when she reached Corcyra, spoke\\nthus with her brother:- \"Dost thou wish the kingdom, brother, to pass\\ninto strange hands, and our father\\'s wealth to be made a prey, rather\\nthan thyself return to enjoy it? Come back home with me, and cease\\nto punish thyself. It is scant gain, this obstinacy. Why seek to cure\\nevil by evil? Mercy, remember, is by many set above justice. Many,\\nalso, while pushing their mother\\'s claims have forfeited their father\\'s\\nfortune. Power is a slippery thing- it has many suitors; and he is\\nold and stricken in years- let not thy own inheritance go to another.\"\\nThus did the sister, who had been tutored by Periander what to say,\\nurge all the arguments most likely to have weight with her brother.\\nHe however made answer, \"That so long as he knew his father to be\\nstill alive, he would never go back to Corinth.\" When the sister brought\\nPeriander this reply, he sent his son a third time by a herald, and\\nsaid he would come himself to Corcyra, and let his son take his place\\nat Corinth as heir to his kingdom. To these terms Lycophron agreed;\\nand Periander was making ready to pass into Corcyra and his son to\\nreturn to Corinth, when the Corcyraeans, being informed of what was\\ntaking place, to keep Periander away, put the young man to death.\\nFor this reason it was that Periander took vengeance on the Corcyraeans.\\n\\nThe Lacedaemonians arrived before Samos with a mighty armament, and\\nforthwith laid siege to the place. In one of the assaults upon the\\nwalls, they forced their way to the top of the tower which stands\\nby the sea on the side where the suburb is, but Polycrates came in\\nperson to the rescue with a strong force, and beat them back. Meanwhile\\nat the upper tower, which stood on the ridge of the hill, the besieged,\\nboth mercenaries and Samians, made a sally; but after they had withstood\\nthe Lacedaemonians a short time, they fled backwards, and the Lacedaemonians,\\npressing upon them, slew numbers. \\n\\nIf now all who were present had behaved that day like Archias and\\nLycopas, two of the Lacedaemonians, Samos might have been taken. For\\nthese two heroes, following hard upon the flying Samians, entered\\nthe city along with them, and, being all alone, and their retreat\\ncut off, were slain within the walls of the place. I myself once fell\\nin with the grandson of this Archias, a man named Archias like his\\ngrandsire, and the son of Samius, whom I met at Pitana, to which canton\\nhe belonged. He respected the Samians beyond all other foreigners,\\nand he told me that his father was called Samius, because his grandfather\\nArchias died in Samos so gloriously, and that the reason why he respected\\nthe Samians so greatly was that his grandsire was buried with public\\nhonours by the Samian people. \\n\\nThe Lacedaemonians besieged Samos during forty days, but not making\\nany progress before the place, they raised the siege at the end of\\nthat time, and returned home to the Peloponnese. There is a silly\\ntale told that Polycrates struck a quantity of the coin of his country\\nin lead, and, coating it with gold, gave it to the Lacedaemonians,\\nwho on receiving it took their departure. \\n\\nThis was the first expedition into Asia of the Lacedaemonian Dorians.\\n\\nThe Samians who had fought against Polycrates, when they knew that\\nthe Lacedaemonians were about to forsake them, left Samos themselves,\\nand sailed to Siphnos. They happened to be in want of money; and the\\nSiphnians at that time were at the height of their greatness, no islanders\\nhaving so much wealth as they. There were mines of gold and silver\\nin their country, and of so rich a yield, that from a tithe of the\\nores the Siphnians furnished out a treasury at Delphi which was on\\na par with the grandest there. What the mines yielded was divided\\nyear by year among the citizens. At the time when they formed the\\ntreasury, the Siphnians consulted the oracle, and asked whether their\\ngood things would remain to them many years. The Pythoness made answer\\nas follows:- \\n\\nWhen the Prytanies\\'seat shines white in the island of Siphnos,\\n\\nWhite-browed all the forum-need then of a true seer\\'s wisdom-\\n\\nDanger will threat from a wooden host, and a herald in scarlet. Now\\nabout this time the forum of the Siphnians and their townhall or prytaneum\\nhad been adorned with Parian marble. \\n\\nThe Siphnians, however, were unable to understand the oracle, either\\nat the time when it was given, or afterwards on the arrival of the\\nSamians. For these last no sooner came to anchor off the island than\\nthey sent one of their vessels, with an ambassage on board, to the\\ncity. All ships in these early times were painted with vermilion;\\nand this was what the Pythoness had meant when she told them to beware\\nof danger \"from a wooden host, and a herald in scarlet.\" So the ambassadors\\ncame ashore and besought the Siphnians to lend them ten talents; but\\nthe Siphnians refused, whereupon the Samians began to plunder their\\nlands. Tidings of this reached the Siphnians, who straightway sallied\\nforth to save their crops; then a battle was fought, in which the\\nSiphnians suffered defeat, and many of their number were cut off from\\nthe city by the Samians, after which these latter forced the Siphnians\\nto give them a hundred talents. \\n\\nWith this money they bought of the Hermionians the island of Hydrea,\\noff the coast of the Peloponnese, and this they gave in trust to the\\nTroezenians, to keep for them, while they themselves went on to Crete,\\nand founded the city of Cydonia. They had not meant, when they set\\nsail, to settle there, but only to drive out the Zacynthians from\\nthe island. However they rested at Cydonia, where they flourished\\ngreatly for five years. It was they who built the various temples\\nthat may still be seen at that place, and among them the fane of Dictyna.\\nBut in the sixth year they were attacked by the Eginetans, who beat\\nthem in a sea-fight, and, with the help of the Cretans, reduced them\\nall to slavery. The beaks of their ships, which carried the figure\\nof a wild boar, they sawed off, and laid them up in the temple of\\nMinerva in Egina. The Eginetans took part against the Samians on account\\nof an ancient grudge, since the Samians had first, when Amphicrates\\nwas king of Samos, made war on them and done great harm to their island,\\nsuffering, however, much damage also themselves. Such was the reason\\nwhich moved the Eginetans to make this attack. \\n\\nI have dwelt the longer on the affairs of the Samians, because three\\nof the greatest works in all Greece were made by them. One is a tunnel,\\nunder a hill one hundred and fifty fathoms high, carried entirely\\nthrough the base of the hill, with a mouth at either end. The length\\nof the cutting is seven furlongs- the height and width are each eight\\nfeet. Along the whole course there is a second cutting, twenty cubits\\ndeep and three feet broad, whereby water is brought, through pipes,\\nfrom an abundant source into the city. The architect of this tunnel\\nwas Eupalinus, son of Naustrophus, a Megarian. Such is the first of\\ntheir great works; the second is a mole in the sea, which goes all\\nround the harbour, near twenty fathoms deep, and in length above two\\nfurlongs. The third is a temple; the largest of all the temples known\\nto us, whereof Rhoecus, son of Phileus, a Samian, was first architect.\\nBecause of these works I have dwelt the longer on the affairs of Samos.\\n\\nWhile Cambyses, son of Cyrus, after losing his senses, still lingered\\nin Egypt, two Magi, brothers, revolted against him. One of them had\\nbeen left in Persia by Cambyses as comptroller of his household; and\\nit was he who began the revolt. Aware that Smerdis was dead, and that\\nhis death was hid and known to few of the Persians, while most believed\\nthat he was still alive, he laid his plan, and made a bold stroke\\nfor the crown. He had a brother- the same of whom I spoke before as\\nhis partner in the revolt- who happened greatly to resemble Smerdis\\nthe son of Cyrus, whom Cambyses his brother had put to death. And\\nnot only was this brother of his like Smerdis in person, but he also\\nbore the selfsame name, to wit Smerdis. Patizeithes, the other Magus,\\nhaving persuaded him that he would carry the whole business through,\\ntook him and made him sit upon the royal throne. Having so done, he\\nsent heralds through all the land, to Egypt and elsewhere, to make\\nproclamation to the troops that henceforth they were to obey Smerdis\\nthe son of Cyrus, and not Cambyses. \\n\\nThe other heralds therefore made proclamation as they were ordered,\\nand likewise the herald whose place it was to proceed into Egypt.\\nHe, when he reached Agbatana in Syria, finding Cambyses and his army\\nthere, went straight into the middle of the host, and standing forth\\nbefore them all, made the proclamation which Patizeithes the Magus\\nhad commanded. Cambyses no sooner heard him, than believing that what\\nthe herald said was true, and imagining that he had been betrayed\\nby Prexaspes (who, he supposed, had not put Smerdis to death when\\nsent into Persia for that purpose), he turned his eyes full upon Prexaspes,\\nand said, \"Is this the way, Prexaspes, that thou didst my errand?\"\\n\"Oh! my liege,\" answered the other, \"there is no truth in the tidings\\nthat Smerdis thy brother has revolted against thee, nor hast thou\\nto fear in time to come any quarrel, great or small, with that man.\\nWith my own hands I wrought thy will on him, and with my own hands\\nI buried him. If of a truth the dead can leave their graves, expect\\nAstyages the Mede to rise and fight against thee; but if the course\\nof nature be the same as formerly, then be sure no ill will ever come\\nupon thee from this quarter. Now, therefore, my counsel is that we\\nsend in pursuit of the herald, and strictly question him who it was\\nthat charged him to bid us obey king Smerdis.\" \\n\\nWhen Prexaspes had so spoken, and Cambyses had approved his words,\\nthe herald was forthwith pursued, and brought back to the king. Then\\nPrexaspes said to him, \"Sirrah, thou bear\\'st us a message, sayst thou,\\nfrom Smerdis, son of Cyrus. Now answer truly, and go thy way scathless.\\nDid Smerdis have thee to his presence and give thee thy orders, or\\nhadst thou them from one of his officers?\" The herald answered, \"Truly\\nI have not set eyes on Smerdis son of Cyrus, since the day when king\\nCambyses led the Persians into Egypt. The man who gave me my orders\\nwas the Magus that Cambyses left in charge of the household; but he\\nsaid that Smerdis son of Cyrus sent you the message.\" In all this\\nthe herald spoke nothing but the strict truth. Then Cambyses said\\nthus to Prexaspes:- \"Thou art free from all blame, Prexaspes, since,\\nas a right good man, thou hast not failed to do the thing which I\\ncommanded. But tell me now, which of the Persians can have taken the\\nname of Smerdis, and revolted from me?\" \"I think, my liege,\" he answered,\\n\"that I apprehend the whole business. The men who have risen in revolt\\nagainst thee are the two Magi, Patizeithes, who was left comptroller\\nof thy household, and his brother, who is named Smerdis.\"\\n\\nCambyses no sooner heard the name of Smerdis than he was struck with\\nthe truth of Prexaspes\\' words, and the fulfilment of his own dream-\\nthe dream, I mean, which he had in former days, when one appeared\\nto him in his sleep and told him that Smerdis sate upon the royal\\nthrone, and with his head touched the heavens. So when he saw that\\nhe had needlessly slain his brother Smerdis, he wept and bewailed\\nhis loss: after which, smarting with vexation as he thought of all\\nhis ill luck, he sprang hastily upon his steed, meaning to march his\\narmy with all haste to Susa against the Magus. As he made his spring,\\nthe button of his sword-sheath fell off, and the bared point entered\\nhis thigh, wounding him exactly where he had himself once wounded\\nthe Egyptian god Apis. Then Cambyses, feeling that he had got his\\ndeath-wound, inquired the name of the place where he was, and was\\nanswered, \"Agbatana.\" Now before this it had been told him by the\\noracle at Buto that he should end his days at Agbatana. He, however,\\nhad understood the Median Agbatana, where all his treasures were,\\nand had thought that he should die there in a good old age; but the\\noracle meant Agbatana in Syria. So when Cambyses heard the name of\\nthe place, the double shock that he had received, from the revolt\\nof the Magus and from his wound, brought him back to his senses. And\\nhe understood now the true meaning of the oracle, and said, \"Here\\nthen Cambyses, son of Cyrus, is doomed to die.\" \\n\\nAt this time he said no more; but twenty days afterwards he called\\nto his presence all the chief Persians who were with the army, and\\naddressed them as follows:- \"Persians, needs must I tell you now what\\nhitherto I have striven with the greatest care to keep concealed.\\nWhen I was in Egypt I saw in my sleep a vision, which would that I\\nhad never beheld! I thought a messenger came to me from my home, and\\ntold me that Smerdis sate upon the royal throne, and with his head\\ntouched the heavens. Then I feared to be cast from my throne by Smerdis\\nmy brother, and I did what was more hasty than wise. Ah! truly, do\\nwhat they may, it is impossible for men to turn aside the coming fate.\\nI, in my folly, sent Prexaspes to Susa to put my brother to death.\\nSo this great woe was accomplished, and I then lived without fear,\\nnever imagining that, after Smerdis was dead, I need dread revolt\\nfrom any other. But herein I had quite mistaken what was about to\\nhappen, and so I slew my brother without any need, and nevertheless\\nhave lost my crown. For it was Smerdis the Magus, and not Smerdis\\nmy brother, of whose rebellion God forewarned me by the vision. The\\ndeed is done, however, and Smerdis, son of Cyrus, be sure is lost\\nto you. The Magi have the royal power- Patizeithes, whom I left at\\nSusa to overlook my household, and Smerdis his brother. There was\\none who would have been bound beyond all others to avenge the wrongs\\nI have suffered from these Magians, but he, alas! has perished by\\na horrid fate, deprived of life by those nearest and dearest to him.\\nIn his default, nothing now remains for me but to tell you, O Persians,\\nwhat I would wish to have done after I have breathed my last. Therefore,\\nin the name of the gods that watch over our royal house, I charge\\nyou all, and specially such of you as are Achaemenids, that ye do\\nnot tamely allow the kingdom to go back to the Medes. Recover it one\\nway or another, by force or fraud; by fraud, if it is by fraud that\\nthey have seized on it; by force, if force has helped them in their\\nenterprise. Do this, and then may your land bring you forth fruit\\nabundantly, and your wives bear children, and your herds increase,\\nand freedom be your portion for ever: but do it not- make no brave\\nstruggle to regain the kingdom- and then my curse be on you, and may\\nthe opposite of all these things happen to you- and not only so, but\\nmay you, one and all, perish at the last by such a fate as mine!\"\\nThen Cambyses, when he left speaking, bewailed his whole misfortune\\nfrom beginning to end. \\n\\nWhereupon the Persians, seeing their king weep, rent the garments\\nthat they had on, and uttered lamentable cries; after which, as the\\nbone presently grew carious, and the limb gangrened, Cambyses, son\\nof Cyrus, died. He had reigned in all seven years and five months,\\nand left no issue behind him, male or female. The Persians who had\\nheard his words, put no faith in anything that he said concerning\\nthe Magi having the royal power; but believed that he spoke out of\\nhatred towards Smerdis, and had invented the tale of his death to\\ncause the whole Persian race to rise up in arms against him. Thus\\nthey were convinced that it was Smerdis the son of Cyrus who had rebelled\\nand now sate on the throne. For Prexaspes stoutly denied that he had\\nslain Smerdis, since it was not safe for him, after Cambyses was dead,\\nto allow that a son of Cyrus had met with death at his hands.\\n\\nThus then Cambyses died, and the Magus now reigned in security, and\\npassed himself off for Smerdis the son of Cyrus. And so went by the\\nseven months which were wanting to complete the eighth year of Cambyses.\\nHis subjects, while his reign lasted, received great benefits from\\nhim, insomuch that, when he died, all the dwellers in Asia mourned\\nhis loss exceedingly, except only the Persians. For no sooner did\\nhe come to the throne than forthwith he sent round to every nation\\nunder his rule, and granted them freedom from war-service and from\\ntaxes for the space of three years. \\n\\nIn the eighth month, however, it was discovered who he was in the\\nmode following. There was a man called Otanes, the son of Pharnaspes,\\nwho for rank and wealth was equal to the greatest of the Persians.\\nThis Otanes was the first to suspect that the Magus was not Smerdis\\nthe son of Cyrus, and to surmise moreover who he really was. He was\\nled to guess the truth by the king never quitting the citadel, and\\nnever calling before him any of the Persian noblemen. As soon, therefore,\\nas his suspicions were aroused he adopted the following measures:-\\nOne of his daughters, who was called Phaedima, had been married to\\nCambyses, and was taken to wife, together with the rest of Cambyses\\'\\nwives, by the Magus. To this daughter Otanes sent a message, and inquired\\nof her \"who it was whose bed she shared,- was it Smerdis the son of\\nCyrus, or was it some other man?\" Phaedima in reply declared she did\\nnot know- Smerdis the son of Cyrus she had never seen, and so she\\ncould not tell whose bed she shared. Upon this Otanes sent a second\\ntime, and said, \"If thou dost not know Smerdis son of Cyrus thyself,\\nask queen Atossa who it is with whom ye both live- she cannot fail\\nto know her own brother.\" To this the daughter made answer, \"I can\\nneither get speech with Atossa, nor with any of the women who lodge\\nin the palace. For no sooner did this man, be he who he may, obtain\\nthe kingdom, than he parted us from one another, and gave us all separate\\nchambers.\" \\n\\nThis made the matter seem still more plain to Otanes. Nevertheless\\nhe sent a third message to his daughter in these words following:-\\n\"Daughter, thou art of noble blood- thou wilt not shrink from a risk\\nwhich thy father bids thee encounter. If this fellow be not Smerdis\\nthe son of Cyrus, but the man whom I think him to be, his boldness\\nin taking thee to be his wife, and lording it over the Persians, must\\nnot be allowed to pass unpunished. Now therefore do as I command-\\nwhen next he passes the night with thee, wait till thou art sure he\\nis fast asleep, and then feel for his ears. If thou findest him to\\nhave ears, then believe him to be Smerdis the son of Cyrus, but if\\nhe has none, know him for Smerdis the Magian.\" Phaedima returned for\\nanswer, \"It would be a great risk. If he was without ears, and caught\\nher feeling for them, she well knew he would make away with her- nevertheless\\nshe would venture.\" So Otanes got his daughter\\'s promise that she\\nwould do as he desired. Now Smerdis the Magian had had his ears cut\\noff in the lifetime of Cyrus son of Cambyses, as a punishment for\\na crime of no slight heinousness. Phaedima therefore, Otanes\\' daughter,\\nbent on accomplishing what she had promised her father, when her turn\\ncame, and she was taken to the bed of the Magus (in Persia a man\\'s\\nwives sleep with him in their turns), waited till he was sound asleep,\\nand then felt for his ears. She quickly perceived that he had no ears;\\nand of this, as soon as day dawned, she sent word to her father.\\n\\nThen Otanes took to him two of the chief Persians, Aspathines and\\nGobryas, men whom it was most advisable to trust in such a matter,\\nand told them everything. Now they had already of themselves suspected\\nhow the matter stood. When Otanes therefore laid his reasons before\\nthem they at once came into his views; and it was agreed that each\\nof the three should take as companion in the work the Persian in whom\\nhe placed the greatest confidence. Then Otanes chose Intaphernes,\\nGobryas Megabyzus, and Aspathines Hydarnes. After the number had thus\\nbecome six, Darius, the son of Hystaspes, arrived at Susa from Persia,\\nwhereof his father was governor. On his coming it seemed good to the\\nsix to take him likewise into their counsels. \\n\\nAfter this, the men, being now seven in all, met together to exchange\\noaths, and hold discourse with one another. And when it came to the\\nturn of Darius to speak his mind, he said as follows:- \"Methought\\nno one but I knew that Smerdis, the son of Cyrus, was not now alive,\\nand that Smerdis the Magian ruled over us; on this account I came\\nhither with speed, to compass the death of the Magian. But as it seems\\nthe matter is known to you all, and not to me only, my judgment is\\nthat we should act at once, and not any longer delay. For to do so\\nwere not well.\" Otanes spoke upon this:- \"Son of Hystaspes,\" said\\nhe, \"thou art the child of a brave father, and seemest likely to show\\nthyself as bold a gallant as he. Beware, however, of rash haste in\\nthis matter; do not hurry so, but proceed with soberness. We must\\nadd to our number ere we adventure to strike the blow.\" \"Not so,\"\\nDarius rejoined; \"for let all present be well assured that if the\\nadvice of Otanes guide our acts, we shall perish most miserably. Some\\none will betray our plot to the Magians for lucre\\'s sake. Ye ought\\nto have kept the matter to yourselves, and so made the venture; but\\nas ye have chosen to take others into your secret, and have opened\\nthe matter to me, take my advice and make the attempt today- or if\\nnot, if a single day be suffered to pass by, be sure that I will let\\nno one betray me to the Magian. I myself will go to him, and plainly\\ndenounce you all.\" \\n\\nOtanes, when he saw Darius so hot, replied, \"But if thou wilt force\\nus to action, and not allow a day\\'s delay, tell us, I pray thee, how\\nwe shall get entrance into the palace, so as to set upon them. Guards\\nare placed everywhere, as thou thyself well knowest- for if thou hast\\nnot seen, at least thou hast heard tell of them. How are we to pass\\nthese guards, I ask thee?\" answered Darius, \"there are many things\\neasy enough in act, which by speech it is hard to explain. There are\\nalso things concerning which speech is easy, but no noble action follows\\nwhen the speech is done. As for these guards, ye know well that we\\nshall not find it hard to make our way through them. Our rank alone\\nwould cause them to allow us to enter- shame and fear alike forbidding\\nthem to say us nay. But besides, I have the fairest plea that can\\nbe conceived for gaining admission. I can say that I have just come\\nfrom Persia, and have a message to deliver to the king from my father.\\nAn untruth must be spoken, where need requires. For whether men lie,\\nor say true, it is with one and the same object. Men lie, because\\nthey think to gain by deceiving others; and speak the truth, because\\nthey expect to get something by their true speaking, and to be trusted\\nafterwards in more important matters. Thus, though their conduct is\\nso opposite, the end of both is alike. If there were no gain to be\\ngot, your true-speaking man would tell untruths as much as your liar,\\nand your liar would tell the truth as much as your true-speaking man.\\nThe doorkeeper, who lets us in readily, shall have his guerdon some\\nday or other; but woe to the man who resists us, he must forthwith\\nbe declared an enemy. Forcing our way past him, we will press in and\\ngo straight to our work.\" \\n\\nAfter Darius had thus said, Gobryas spoke as follows:- \"Dear friends,\\nwhen will a fitter occasion offer for us to recover the kingdom, or,\\nif we are not strong enough, at least die in the attempt? Consider\\nthat we Persians are governed by a Median Magus, and one, too, who\\nhas had his ears cut off! Some of you were present when Cambyses lay\\nupon his deathbed- such, doubtless, remember what curses he called\\ndown upon the Persians if they made no effort to recover the kingdom.\\nThen, indeed, we paid but little heed to what he said, because we\\nthought he spoke out of hatred to set us against his brother. Now,\\nhowever, my vote is that we do as Darius has counselled- march straight\\nin a body to the palace from the place where we now are, and forthwith\\nset upon the Magian.\" So Gobryas spake, and the others all approved.\\n\\nWhile the seven were thus taking counsel together, it so chanced that\\nthe following events were happening:- The Magi had been thinking what\\nthey had best do, and had resolved for many reasons to make a friend\\nof Prexaspes. They knew how cruelly he had been outraged by Cambyses,\\nwho slew his son with an arrow; they were also aware that it was by\\nhis hand that Smerdis the son of Cyrus fell, and that he was the only\\nperson privy to that prince\\'s death; and they further found him to\\nbe held in the highest esteem by all the Persians. So they called\\nhim to them, made him their friend, and bound him by a promise and\\nby oaths to keep silence about the fraud which they were practising\\nupon the Persians, and not discover it to any one; and they pledged\\nthemselves that in this case they would give him thousands of gifts\\nof every sort and kind. So Prexaspes agreed, and the Magi, when they\\nfound that they had persuaded him so far, went on to another proposal,\\nand said they would assemble the Persians at the foot of the palace\\nwall, and he should mount one of the towers and harangue them from\\nit, assuring them that Smerdis the son of Cyrus, and none but he,\\nruled the land. This they bade him do, because Prexaspes was a man\\nof great weight with his countrymen, and had often declared in public\\nthat Smerdis the son of Cyrus was still alive, and denied being his\\nmurderer. \\n\\nPrexaspes said he was quite ready to do their will in the matter;\\nso the Magi assembled the people, and placed Prexaspes upon the top\\nof the tower, and told him to make his speech. Then this man, forgetting\\nof set purpose all that the Magi had intreated him to say, began with\\nAchaeamenes, and traced down the descent of Cyrus; after which, when\\nhe came to that king, he recounted all the services that had been\\nrendered by him to the Persians, from whence he went on to declare\\nthe truth, which hitherto he had concealed, he said, because it would\\nnot have been safe for him to make it known, but now necessity was\\nlaid on him to disclose the whole. Then he told how, forced to it\\nby Cambyses, he had himself taken the life of Smerdis, son of Cyrus,\\nand how that Persia was now ruled by the Magi. Last of all, with many\\ncurses upon the Persians if they did not recover the kingdom, and\\nwreak vengeance on the Magi, he threw himself headlong from the tower\\ninto the abyss below. Such was the end of Prexaspes, a man all his\\nlife of high repute among the Persians. \\n\\nAnd now the seven Persians, having resolved that they would attack\\nthe Magi without more delay, first offered prayers to the gods and\\nthen set off for the palace, quite unacquainted with what had been\\ndone by Prexaspes. The news of his doings reached them upon their\\nway, when they had accomplished about half the distance. Hereupon\\nthey turned aside out of the road, and consulted together. Otanes\\nand his party said they must certainly put off the business, and not\\nmake the attack when affairs were in such a ferment. Darius, on the\\nother hand, and his friends, were against any change of plan, and\\nwished to go straight on, and not lose a moment. Now, as they strove\\ntogether, suddenly there came in sight two pairs of vultures, and\\nseven pairs of hawks, pursuing them, and the hawks tore the vultures\\nboth with their claws and bills. At this sight the seven with one\\naccord came in to the opinion of Darius, and encouraged by the omen\\nhastened on towards the palace. \\n\\nAt the gate they were received as Darius had foretold. The guards,\\nwho had no suspicion that they came for any ill purpose, and held\\nthe chief Persians in much reverence, let them pass without difficulty-\\nit seemed as if they were under the special protection of the gods-\\nnone even asked them any question. When they were now in the great\\ncourt they fell in with certain of the eunuchs, whose business it\\nwas to carry the king\\'s messages, who stopped them and asked what\\nthey wanted, while at the same time they threatened the doorkeepers\\nfor having let them enter. The seven sought to press on, but the eunuchs\\nwould not suffer them. Then these men, with cheers encouraging one\\nanother, drew their daggers, and stabbing those who strove to withstand\\nthem, rushed forward to the apartment of the males. \\n\\nNow both the Magi were at this time within, holding counsel upon the\\nmatter of Prexaspes. So when they heard the stir among the eunuchs,\\nand their loud cries, they ran out themselves, to see what was happening.\\nInstantly perceiving their danger, they both flew to arms; one had\\njust time to seize his bow, the other got hold of his lance; when\\nstraightway the fight began. The one whose weapon was the bow found\\nit of no service at all; the foe was too near, and the combat too\\nclose to allow of his using it. But the other made a stout defence\\nwith his lance, wounding two of the seven, Aspathines in the leg,\\nand Intaphernes in the eye. This wound did not kill Intaphernes, but\\nit cost him the sight of that eye. The other Magus, when he found\\nhis bow of no avail, fled into a chamber which opened out into the\\napartment of the males, intending to shut to the doors. But two of\\nthe seven entered the room with him, Darius and Gobryas. Gobryas seized\\nthe Magus and grappled with him, while Darius stood over them, not\\nknowing what to do; for it was dark, and he was afraid that if he\\nstruck a blow he might kill Gobryas. Then Gobyras, when he perceived\\nthat Darius stood doing nothing, asked him, \"why his hand was idle?\"\\n\"I fear to hurt thee,\" he answered. \"Fear not,\" said Gobryas; \"strike,\\nthough it be through both.\" Darius did as he desired, drove his dagger\\nhome, and by good hap killed the Magus. \\n\\nThus were the Magi slain; and the seven, cutting off both the heads,\\nand leaving their own wounded in the palace, partly because they were\\ndisabled, and partly to guard the citadel, went forth from the gates\\nwith the heads in their hands, shouting and making an uproar. They\\ncalled out to all the Persians whom they met, and told them what had\\nhappened, showing them the heads of the Magi, while at the same time\\nthey slew every Magus who fell in their way. Then the Persians, when\\nthey knew what the seven had done, and understood the fraud of the\\nMagi, thought it but just to follow the example set them, and, drawing\\ntheir daggers, they killed the Magi wherever they could find any.\\nSuch was their fury, that, unless night had closed in, not a single\\nMagus would have been left alive. The Persians observe this day with\\none accord, and keep it more strictly than any other in the whole\\nyear. It is then that they hold the great festival, which they call\\nthe Magophonia. No Magus may show himself abroad during the whole\\ntime that the feast lasts; but all must remain at home the entire\\nday. \\n\\nAnd now when five days were gone, and the hubbub had settled down,\\nthe conspirators met together to consult about the situation of affairs.\\nAt this meeting speeches were made, to which many of the Greeks give\\nno credence, but they were made nevertheless. Otanes recommended that\\nthe management of public affairs should be entrusted to the whole\\nnation. \"To me,\" he said, \"it seems advisable, that we should no longer\\nhave a single man to rule over us- the rule of one is neither good\\nnor pleasant. Ye cannot have forgotten to what lengths Cambyses went\\nin his haughty tyranny, and the haughtiness of the Magi ye have yourselves\\nexperienced. How indeed is it possible that monarchy should be a well-adjusted\\nthing, when it allows a man to do as he likes without being answerable?\\nSuch licence is enough to stir strange and unwonted thoughts in the\\nheart of the worthiest of men. Give a person this power, and straightway\\nhis manifold good things puff him up with pride, while envy is so\\nnatural to human kind that it cannot but arise in him. But pride and\\nenvy together include all wickedness- both of them leading on to deeds\\nof savage violence. True it is that kings, possessing as they do all\\nthat heart can desire, ought to be void of envy; but the contrary\\nis seen in their conduct towards the citizens. They are jealous of\\nthe most virtuous among their subjects, and wish their death; while\\nthey take delight in the meanest and basest, being ever ready to listen\\nto the tales of slanderers. A king, besides, is beyond all other men\\ninconsistent with himself. Pay him court in moderation, and he is\\nangry because you do not show him more profound respect- show him\\nprofound respect, and he is offended again, because (as he says) you\\nfawn on him. But the worst of all is, that he sets aside the laws\\nof the land, puts men to death without trial, and subjects women to\\nviolence. The rule of the many, on the other hand, has, in the first\\nplace, the fairest of names, to wit, isonomy; and further it is free\\nfrom all those outrages which a king is wont to commit. There, places\\nare given by lot, the magistrate is answerable for what he does, and\\nmeasures rest with the commonalty. I vote, therefore, that we do away\\nwith monarchy, and raise the people to power. For the people are all\\nin all.\" \\n\\nSuch were the sentiments of Otanes. Megabyzus spoke next, and advised\\nthe setting up of an oligarchy:- \"In all that Otanes has said to persuade\\nyou to put down monarchy,\" he observed, \"I fully concur; but his recommendation\\nthat we should call the people to power seems to me not the best advice.\\nFor there is nothing so void of understanding, nothing so full of\\nwantonness, as the unwieldy rabble. It were folly not to be borne,\\nfor men, while seeking to escape the wantonness of a tyrant, to give\\nthemselves up to the wantonness of a rude unbridled mob. The tyrant,\\nin all his doings, at least knows what is he about, but a mob is altogether\\ndevoid of knowledge; for how should there be any knowledge in a rabble,\\nuntaught, and with no natural sense of what is right and fit? It rushes\\nwildly into state affairs with all the fury of a stream swollen in\\nthe winter, and confuses everything. Let the enemies of the Persians\\nbe ruled by democracies; but let us choose out from the citizens a\\ncertain number of the worthiest, and put the government into their\\nhands. For thus both we ourselves shall be among the governors, and\\npower being entrusted to the best men, it is likely that the best\\ncounsels will prevail in the state.\" \\n\\nThis was the advice which Megabyzus gave, and after him Darius came\\nforward, and spoke as follows:- \"All that Megabyzus said against democracy\\nwas well said, I think; but about oligarchy he did not speak advisedly;\\nfor take these three forms of government- democracy, oligarchy, and\\nmonarchy- and let them each be at their best, I maintain that monarchy\\nfar surpasses the other two. What government can possibly be better\\nthan that of the very best man in the whole state? The counsels of\\nsuch a man are like himself, and so he governs the mass of the people\\nto their heart\\'s content; while at the same time his measures against\\nevil-doers are kept more secret than in other states. Contrariwise,\\nin oligarchies, where men vie with each other in the service of the\\ncommonwealth, fierce enmities are apt to arise between man and man,\\neach wishing to be leader, and to carry his own measures; whence violent\\nquarrels come, which lead to open strife, often ending in bloodshed.\\nThen monarchy is sure to follow; and this too shows how far that rule\\nsurpasses all others. Again, in a democracy, it is impossible but\\nthat there will be malpractices: these malpractices, however, do not\\nlead to enmities, but to close friendships, which are formed among\\nthose engaged in them, who must hold well together to carry on their\\nvillainies. And so things go on until a man stands forth as champion\\nof the commonalty, and puts down the evil-doers. Straightway the author\\nof so great a service is admired by all, and from being admired soon\\ncomes to be appointed king; so that here too it is plain that monarchy\\nis the best government. Lastly, to sum up all in a word, whence, I\\nask, was it that we got the freedom which we enjoy?- did democracy\\ngive it us, or oligarchy, or a monarch? As a single man recovered\\nour freedom for us, my sentence is that we keep to the rule of one.\\nEven apart from this, we ought not to change the laws of our forefathers\\nwhen they work fairly; for to do so is not well.\" \\n\\nSuch were the three opinions brought forward at this meeting; the\\nfour other Persians voted in favour of the last. Otanes, who wished\\nto give his countrymen a democracy, when he found the decision against\\nhim, arose a second time, and spoke thus before the assembly:- \"Brother\\nconspirators, it is plain that the king who is to be chosen will be\\none of ourselves, whether we make the choice by casting lots for the\\nprize, or by letting the people decide which of us they will have\\nto rule over them, in or any other way. Now, as I have neither a mind\\nto rule nor to be ruled, I shall not enter the lists with you in this\\nmatter. I withdraw, however, on one condition- none of you shall claim\\nto exercise rule over me or my seed for ever.\" The six agreed to these\\nterms, and Otanes withdraw and stood aloof from the contest. And still\\nto this day the family of Otanes continues to be the only free family\\nin Persia; those who belong to it submit to the rule of the king only\\nso far as they themselves choose; they are bound, however, to observe\\nthe laws of the land like the other Persians. \\n\\nAfter this the six took counsel together, as to the fairest way of\\nsetting up a king: and first, with respect to Otanes, they resolved,\\nthat if any of their own number got the kingdom, Otanes and his seed\\nafter him should receive year by year, as a mark of special honour,\\na Median robe, and all such other gifts as are accounted the most\\nhonourable in Persia. And these they resolved to give him, because\\nhe was the man who first planned the outbreak, and who brought the\\nseven together. These privileges, therefore, were assigned specially\\nto Otanes. The following were made common to them all:- It was to\\nbe free to each, whenever he pleased, to enter the palace unannounced,\\nunless the king were in the company of one of his wives; and the king\\nwas to be bound to marry into no family excepting those of the conspirators.\\nConcerning the appointment of a king, the resolve to which they came\\nwas the following:- They would ride out together next morning into\\nthe skirts of the city, and he whose steed first neighed after the\\nsun was up should have the kingdom. \\n\\nNow Darius had a groom, a sharp-witted knave, called Oebares. After\\nthe meeting had broken up, Darius sent for him, and said, \"Oebares,\\nthis is the way in which the king is to be chosen- we are to mount\\nour horses, and the man whose horse first neighs after the sun is\\nup is to have the kingdom. If then you have any cleverness, contrive\\na plan whereby the prize may fall to us, and not go to another.\" \"Truly,\\nmaster,\" Oebares answered, \"if it depends on this whether thou shalt\\nbe king or no, set thine heart at ease, and fear nothing: I have a\\ncharm which is sure not to fail.\" \"If thou hast really aught of the\\nkind,\" said Darius, \"hasten to get it ready. The matter does not brook\\ndelay, for the trial is to be to-morrow.\" So Oebares when he heard\\nthat, did as follows:- When night came, he took one of the mares,\\nthe chief favourite of the horse which Darius rode, and tethering\\nit in the suburb, brought his master\\'s horse to the place; then, after\\nleading him round and round the mare several times, nearer and nearer\\nat each circuit, he ended by letting them come together.\\n\\nAnd now, when the morning broke, the six Persians, according to agreement,\\nmet together on horseback, and rode out to the suburb. As they went\\nalong they neared the spot where the mare was tethered the night before,\\nwhereupon the horse of Darius sprang forward and neighed. just at\\nthe same time, though the sky was clear and bright, there was a flash\\nof lightning, followed by a thunderclap. It seemed as if the heavens\\nconspired with Darius, and hereby inaugurated him king: so the five\\nother nobles leaped with one accord from their steeds, and bowed down\\nbefore him and owned him for their king. \\n\\nThis is the account which some of the Persians gave of the contrivance\\nof Oebares; but there are others who relate the matter differently.\\nThey say that in the morning he stroked the mare with his hand, which\\nhe then hid in his trousers until the sun rose and the horses were\\nabout to start, when he suddenly drew his hand forth and put it to\\nthe nostrils of his master\\'s horse, which immediately snorted and\\nneighed. \\n\\nThus was Darius, son of Hystaspes, appointed king; and, except the\\nArabians, all they of Asia were subject to him; for Cyrus, and after\\nhim Cambyses, had brought them all under. The Arabians were never\\nsubject as slaves to the Persians, but had a league of friendship\\nwith them from the time when they brought Cambyses on his way as he\\nwent into Egypt; for had they been unfriendly the Persians could never\\nhave made their invasion. \\n\\nAnd now Darius contracted marriages of the first rank, according to\\nthe notions of the Persians: to wit, with two daughters of Cyrus,\\nAtossa and Artystone; of whom, Atossa had been twice married before,\\nonce to Cambyses, her brother, and once to the Magus, while the other,\\nArtystone, was a virgin. He married also Parmys, daughter of Smerdis,\\nson of Cyrus; and he likewise took to wife the daughter of Otanes,\\nwho had made the discovery about the Magus. And now when his power\\nwas established firmly throughout all the kingdoms, the first thing\\nthat he did was to set up a carving in stone, which showed a man mounted\\nupon a horse, with an inscription in these words following:- \"Darius,\\nson of Hystaspes, by aid of his good horse\" (here followed the horse\\'s\\nname), \"and of his good groom Oebares, got himself the kingdom of\\nthe Persians.\" \\n\\nThis he set up in Persia; and afterwards he proceeded to establish\\ntwenty governments of the kind which the Persians call satrapies,\\nassigning to each its governor, and fixing the tribute which was to\\nbe paid him by the several nations. And generally he joined together\\nin one satrapy the nations that were neighbours, but sometimes he\\npassed over the nearer tribes, and put in their stead those which\\nwere more remote. The following is an account of these governments,\\nand of the yearly tribute which they paid to the king:- Such as brought\\ntheir tribute in silver were ordered to pay according to the Babylonian\\ntalent; while the Euboic was the standard measure for such as brought\\ngold. Now the Babylonian talent contains seventy Euboic minae. During\\nall the reign of Cyrus, and afterwards when Cambyses ruled, there\\nwere no fixed tributes, but the nations severally brought gifts to\\nthe king. On account of this and other like doings, the Persians say\\nthat Darius was a huckster, Cambyses a master, and Cyrus a father;\\nfor Darius looked to making a gain in everything; Cambyses was harsh\\nand reckless; while Cyrus was gentle, and procured them all manner\\nof goods. \\n\\nThe Ionians, the Magnesians of Asia, the Aeolians, the Carians, the\\nLycians, the Milyans, and the Pamphylians, paid their tribute in a\\nsingle sum, which was fixed at four hundred talents of silver. These\\nformed together the first satrapy. \\n\\nThe Mysians, Lydians, Lasonians, Cabalians, and Hygennians paid the\\nsum of five hundred talents. This was the second satrapy.\\n\\nThe Hellespontians, of the right coast as one enters the straits,\\nthe Phrygians, the Asiatic Thracians, the Paphlagonians, the Mariandynians\\'\\nand the Syrians paid a tribute of three hundred and sixty talents.\\nThis was the third satrapy. \\n\\nThe Cilicians gave three hundred and sixty white horses, one for each\\nday in the year, and five hundred talents of silver. Of this sum one\\nhundred and forty talents went to pay the cavalry which guarded the\\ncountry, while the remaining three hundred and sixty were received\\nby Darius. This was the fourth satrapy. \\n\\nThe country reaching from the city of Posideium (built by Amphilochus,\\nson of Amphiaraus, on the confines of Syria and Cilicia) to the borders\\nof Egypt, excluding therefrom a district which belonged to Arabia\\nand was free from tax, paid a tribute of three hundred and fifty talents.\\nAll Phoenicia, Palestine Syria, and Cyprus, were herein contained.\\nThis was the fifth satrapy. \\n\\nFrom Egypt, and the neighbouring parts of Libya, together with the\\ntowns of Cyrene and Barca, which belonged to the Egyptian satrapy,\\nthe tribute which came in was seven hundred talents. These seven hundred\\ntalents did not include the profits of the fisheries of Lake Moeris,\\nnor the corn furnished to the troops at Memphis. Corn was supplied\\nto 120,000 Persians, who dwelt at Memphis in the quarter called the\\nWhite Castle, and to a number of auxiliaries. This was the sixth satrapy.\\n\\nThe Sattagydians, the Gandarians, the Dadicae, and the Aparytae, who\\nwere all reckoned together, paid a tribute of a hundred and seventy\\ntalents. This was the seventh satrapy. \\n\\nSusa, and the other parts of Cissia, paid three hundred talents. This\\nwas the eighth satrapy. \\n\\nFrom Babylonia, and the rest of Assyria, were drawn a thousand talents\\nof silver, and five hundred boy-eunuchs. This was the ninth satrapy.\\n\\nAgbatana, and the other parts of Media, together with the Paricanians\\nand Orthocorybantes, paid in all four hundred and fifty talents. This\\nwas the tenth satrapy. \\n\\nThe Caspians, Pausicae, Pantimathi, and Daritae, were joined in one\\ngovernment, and paid the sum of two hundred talents. This was the\\neleventh satrapy. \\n\\nFrom the Bactrian tribes as far as the Aegli the tribute received\\nwas three hundred and sixty talents. This was the twelfth satrapy.\\n\\nFrom Pactyica, Armenia, and the countries reaching thence to the Euxine,\\nthe sum drawn was four hundred talents. This was the thirteenth satrapy.\\n\\nThe Sagartians, Sarangians, Thamanaeans, Utians, and Mycians, together\\nwith the inhabitants of the islands in the Erythraean sea, where the\\nking sends those whom he banishes, furnished altogether a tribute\\nof six hundred talents. This was the fourteenth satrapy.\\n\\nThe Sacans and Caspians gave two hundred and fifty talents. This was\\nthe fifteenth satrapy. \\n\\nThe Parthians, Chorasmians, Sogdians, and Arians, gave three hundred.\\nThis was the sixteenth satrapy. \\n\\nThe Paricanians and Ethiopians of Asia furnished a tribute of four\\nhundred talents. This was the seventeenth satrapy. \\n\\nThe Matienians, Saspeires, and Alarodians were rated to pay two hundred\\ntalents. This was the eighteenth satrapy. \\n\\nThe Moschi, Tibareni, Macrones, Mosynoeci, and Mares had to pay three\\nhundred talents. This was the nineteenth satrapy. \\n\\nThe Indians, who are more numerous than any other nation with which\\nwe are acquainted, paid a tribute exceeding that of every other people,\\nto wit, three hundred and sixty talents of gold-dust. This was the\\ntwentieth satrapy. \\n\\nIf the Babylonian money here spoken of be reduced to the Euboic scale,\\nit will make nine thousand five hundred and forty such talents; and\\nif the gold be reckoned at thirteen times the worth of silver, the\\nIndian gold-dust will come to four thousand six hundred and eighty\\ntalents. Add these two amounts together and the whole revenue which\\ncame in to Darius year by year will be found to be in Euboic money\\nfourteen thousand five hundred and sixty talents, not to mention parts\\nof a talent. \\n\\nSuch was the revenue which Darius derived from Asia and a small part\\nof Libya. Later in his reign the sum was increased by the tribute\\nof the islands, and of the nations of Europe as far as Thessaly. The\\nGreat King stores away the tribute which he receives after this fashion-\\nhe melts it down, and, while it is in a liquid state, runs it into\\nearthen vessels, which are afterwards removed, leaving the metal in\\na solid mass. When money is wanted, he coins as much of this bullion\\nas the occasion requires. \\n\\nSuch then were the governments, and such the amounts of tribute at\\nwhich they were assessed respectively. Persia alone has not been reckoned\\namong the tributaries- and for this reason, because the country of\\nthe Persians is altogether exempt from tax. The following peoples\\npaid no settled tribute, but brought gifts to the king: first, the\\nEthiopians bordering upon Egypt, who were reduced by Cambyses when\\nhe made war on the long-lived Ethiopians, and who dwell about the\\nsacred city of Nysa, and have festivals in honour of Bacchus. The\\ngrain on which they and their next neighbours feed is the same as\\nthat used by the Calantian Indians. Their dwelling-houses are under\\nground. Every third year these two nations brought- and they still\\nbring to my day- two choenices of virgin gold, two hundred logs of\\nebony, five Ethiopian boys, and twenty elephant tusks. The Colchians,\\nand the neighbouring tribes who dwell between them and the Caucasus-\\nfor so far the Persian rule reaches, while north of the Caucasus no\\none fears them any longer- undertook to furnish a gift, which in my\\nday was still brought every fifth year, consisting of a hundred boys,\\nand the same number of maidens. The Arabs brought every year a thousand\\ntalents of frankincense. Such were the gifts which the king received\\nover and above the tribute-money. \\n\\nThe way in which the Indians get the plentiful supply of gold which\\nenables them to furnish year by year so vast an amount of gold-dust\\nto the kind is the following:- eastward of India lies a tract which\\nis entirely sand. Indeed of all the inhabitants of Asia, concerning\\nwhom anything certain is known, the Indians dwell the nearest to the\\neast, and the rising of the sun. Beyond them the whole country is\\ndesert on account of the sand. The tribes of Indians are numerous,\\nand do not all speak the same language- some are wandering tribes,\\nothers not. They who dwell in the marshes along the river live on\\nraw fish, which they take in boats made of reeds, each formed out\\nof a single joint. These Indians wear a dress of sedge, which they\\ncut in the river and bruise; afterwards they weave it into mats, and\\nwear it as we wear a breast-plate. \\n\\nEastward of these Indians are another tribe, called Padaeans, who\\nare wanderers, and live on raw flesh. This tribe is said to have the\\nfollowing customs:- If one of their number be ill, man or woman, they\\ntake the sick person, and if he be a man, the men of his acquaintance\\nproceed to put him to death, because, they say, his flesh would be\\nspoilt for them if he pined and wasted away with sickness. The man\\nprotests he is not ill in the least; but his friends will not accept\\nhis denial- in spite of all he can say, they kill him, and feast themselves\\non his body. So also if a woman be sick, the women, who are her friends,\\ntake her and do with her exactly the same as the men. If one of them\\nreaches to old age, about which there is seldom any question, as commonly\\nbefore that time they have had some disease or other, and so have\\nbeen put to death- but if a man, notwithstanding, comes to be old,\\nthen they offer him in sacrifice to their gods, and afterwards eat\\nhis flesh. \\n\\nThere is another set of Indians whose customs are very different.\\nThey refuse to put any live animal to death, they sow no corn, and\\nhave no dwelling-houses. Vegetables are their only food. There is\\na plant which grows wild in their country, bearing seed, about the\\nsize of millet-seed, in a calyx: their wont is to gather this seed\\nand having boiled it, calyx and all, to use it for food. If one of\\nthem is attacked with sickness, he goes forth into the wilderness,\\nand lies down to die; no one has the least concern either for the\\nsick or for the dead. \\n\\nAll the tribes which I have mentioned live together like the brute\\nbeasts: they have also all the same tint of skin, which approaches\\nthat of the Ethiopians. Their country is a long way from Persia towards\\nthe south: nor had king Darius ever any authority over them.\\n\\nBesides these, there are Indians of another tribe, who border on the\\ncity of Caspatyrus, and the country of Pactyica; these people dwell\\nnorthward of all the rest of the Indians, and follow nearly the same\\nmode of life as the Bactrians. They are more warlike than any of the\\nother tribes, and from them the men are sent forth who go to procure\\nthe gold. For it is in this part of India that the sandy desert lies.\\nHere, in this desert, there live amid the sand great ants, in size\\nsomewhat less than dogs, but bigger than foxes. The Persian king has\\na number of them, which have been caught by the hunters in the land\\nwhereof we are speaking. Those ants make their dwellings under ground,\\nand like the Greek ants, which they very much resemble in shape, throw\\nup sand-heaps as they burrow. Now the sand which they throw up is\\nfull of gold. The Indians, when they go into the desert to collect\\nthis sand, take three camels and harness them together, a female in\\nthe middle and a male on either side, in a leading-rein. The rider\\nsits on the female, and they are particular to choose for the purpose\\none that has but just dropped her young; for their female camels can\\nrun as fast as horses, while they bear burthens very much better.\\n\\nAs the Greeks are well acquainted with the shape of the camel, I shall\\nnot trouble to describe it; but I shall mention what seems to have\\nescaped their notice. The camel has in its hind legs four thigh-bones\\nand four knee-joints. \\n\\nWhen the Indians therefore have thus equipped themselves they set\\noff in quest of the gold, calculating the time so that they may be\\nengaged in seizing it during the most sultry part of the day, when\\nthe ants hide themselves to escape the heat. The sun in those parts\\nshines fiercest in the morning, not, as elsewhere, at noonday; the\\ngreatest heat is from the time when he has reached a certain height,\\nuntil the hour at which the market closes. During this space he burns\\nmuch more furiously than at midday in Greece, so that the men there\\nare said at that time to drench themselves with water. At noon his\\nheat is much the same in India as in other countries, after which,\\nas the day declines, the warmth is only equal to that of the morning\\nsun elsewhere. Towards evening the coolness increases, till about\\nsunset it becomes very cold. \\n\\nWhen the Indians reach the place where the gold is, they fill their\\nbags with the sand, and ride away at their best speed: the ants, however,\\nscenting them, as the Persians say, rush forth in pursuit. Now these\\nanimals are, they declare, so swift, that there is nothing in the\\nworld like them: if it were not, therefore, that the Indians get a\\nstart while the ants are mustering, not a single gold-gatherer could\\nescape. During the flight the male camels, which are not so fleet\\nas the females, grow tired, and begin to drag, first one, and then\\nthe other; but the females recollect the young which they have left\\nbehind, and never give way or flag. Such, according to the Persians,\\nis the manner in which the Indians get the greater part of their gold;\\nsome is dug out of the earth, but of this the supply is more scanty.\\n\\nIt seems as if the extreme regions of the earth were blessed by nature\\nwith the most excellent productions, just in the same way that Greece\\nenjoys a climate more excellently tempered than any other country.\\nIn India, which, as I observed lately, is the furthest region of the\\ninhabited world towards the east, all the four-footed beasts and the\\nbirds are very much bigger than those found elsewhere, except only\\nthe horses, which are surpassed by the Median breed called the Nisaean.\\nGold too is produced there in vast abundance, some dug from the earth,\\nsome washed down by the rivers, some carried off in the mode which\\nI have but now described. And further, there are trees which grow\\nwild there, the fruit whereof is a wool exceeding in beauty and goodness\\nthat of sheep. The natives make their clothes of this tree-wool.\\n\\nArabia is the last of inhabited lands towards the south, and it is\\nthe only country which produces frankincense, myrrh, cassia, cinnamon,\\nand ledanum. The Arabians do not get any of these, except the myrrh,\\nwithout trouble. The frankincense they procure by means of the gum\\nstyrax, which the Greeks obtain from the Phoenicians; this they burn,\\nand thereby obtain the spice. For the trees which bear the frankincense\\nare guarded by winged serpents, small in size, and of varied colours,\\nwhereof vast numbers hang about every tree. They are of the same kind\\nas the serpents that invade Egypt; and there is nothing but the smoke\\nof the styrax which will drive them from the trees. \\n\\nThe Arabians say that the whole world would swarm with these serpents,\\nif they were not kept in check in the way in which I know that vipers\\nare. Of a truth Divine Providence does appear to be, as indeed one\\nmight expect beforehand, a wise contriver. For timid animals which\\nare a prey to others are all made to produce young abundantly, that\\nso the species may not be entirely eaten up and lost; while savage\\nand noxious creatures are made very unfruitful. The hare, for instance,\\nwhich is hunted alike by beasts, birds, and men, breeds so abundantly\\nas even to superfetate, a thing which is true of no other animal.\\nYou find in a hare\\'s belly, at one and the same time, some of the\\nyoung all covered with fur, others quite naked, others again just\\nfully formed in the womb, while the hare perhaps has lately conceived\\nafresh. The lioness, on the other hand, which is one of the strongest\\nand boldest of brutes, brings forth young but once in her lifetime,\\nand then a single cub; she cannot possibly conceive again, since she\\nloses her womb at the same time that she drops her young. The reason\\nof this is that as soon as the cub begins to stir inside the dam,\\nhis claws, which are sharper than those of any other animal, scratch\\nthe womb; as the time goes on, and he grows bigger, he tears it ever\\nmore and more; so that at last, when the birth comes, there is not\\na morsel in the whole womb that is sound. \\n\\nNow with respect to the vipers and the winged snakes of Arabia, if\\nthey increased as fast as their nature would allow, impossible were\\nit for man to maintain himself upon the earth. Accordingly it is found\\nthat when the male and female come together, at the very moment of\\nimpregnation, the female seizes the male by the neck, and having once\\nfastened, cannot be brought to leave go till she has bit the neck\\nentirely through. And so the male perishes; but after a while he is\\nrevenged upon the female by means of the young, which, while still\\nunborn, gnaw a passage through the womb, and then through the belly\\nof their mother, and so make their entrance into the world. Contrariwise,\\nother snakes, which are harmless, lay eggs, and hatch a vast number\\nof young. Vipers are found in all parts of the world, but the winged\\nserpents are nowhere seen except in Arabia, where they are all congregated\\ntogether. This makes them appear so numerous. \\n\\nSuch, then, is the way in which the Arabians obtain their frankincense;\\ntheir manner of collecting the cassia is the following:- They cover\\nall their body and their face with the hides of oxen and other skins,\\nleaving only holes for the eyes, and thus protected go in search of\\nthe cassia, which grows in a lake of no great depth. All round the\\nshores and in the lake itself there dwell a number of winged animals,\\nmuch resembling bats, which screech horribly, and are very valiant.\\nThese creatures they must keep from their eyes all the while that\\nthey gather the cassia. \\n\\nStill more wonderful is the mode in which they collect the cinnamon.\\nWhere the wood grows, and what country produces it, they cannot tell-\\nonly some, following probability, relate that it comes from the country\\nin which Bacchus was brought up. Great birds, they say, bring the\\nsticks which we Greeks, taking the word from the Phoenicians, call\\ncinnamon, and carry them up into the air to make their nests. These\\nare fastened with a sort of mud to a sheer face of rock, where no\\nfoot of man is able to climb. So the Arabians, to get the cinnamon,\\nuse the following artifice. They cut all the oxen and asses and beasts\\nof burthen that die in their land into large pieces, which they carry\\nwith them into those regions, and Place near the nests: then they\\nwithdraw to a distance, and the old birds, swooping down, seize the\\npieces of meat and fly with them up to their nests; which, not being\\nable to support the weight, break off and fall to the ground. Hereupon\\nthe Arabians return and collect the cinnamon, which is afterwards\\ncarried from Arabia into other countries. \\n\\nLedanum, which the Arabs call ladanum, is procured in a yet stranger\\nfashion. Found in a most inodorous place, it is the sweetest-scented\\nof all substances. It is gathered from the beards of he-goats, where\\nit is found sticking like gum, having come from the bushes on which\\nthey browse. It is used in many sorts of unguents, and is what the\\nArabs burn chiefly as incense. \\n\\nConcerning the spices of Arabia let no more be said. The whole country\\nis scented with them, and exhales an odour marvellously sweet. There\\nare also in Arabia two kinds of sheep worthy of admiration, the like\\nof which is nowhere else to be seen; the one kind has long tails,\\nnot less than three cubits in length, which, if they were allowed\\nto trail on the ground, would be bruised and fall into sores. As it\\nis, all the shepherds know enough of carpentering to make little trucks\\nfor their sheep\\'s tails. The trucks are placed under the tails, each\\nsheep having one to himself, and the tails are then tied down upon\\nthem. The other kind has a broad tail, which is a cubit across sometimes.\\n\\nWhere the south declines towards the setting sun lies the country\\ncalled Ethiopia, the last inhabited land in that direction. There\\ngold is obtained in great plenty, huge elephants abound, with wild\\ntrees of all sorts, and ebony; and the men are taller, handsomer,\\nand longer lived than anywhere else. \\n\\nNow these are the farthest regions of the world in Asia and Libya.\\nOf the extreme tracts of Europe towards the west I cannot speak with\\nany certainty; for I do not allow that there is any river, to which\\nthe barbarians give the name of Eridanus, emptying itself into the\\nnorthern sea, whence (as the tale goes) amber is procured; nor do\\nI know of any islands called the Cassiterides (Tin Islands), whence\\nthe tin comes which we use. For in the first place the name Eridanus\\nis manifestly not a barbarian word at all, but a Greek name, invented\\nby some poet or other; and secondly, though I have taken vast pains,\\nI have never been able to get an assurance from an eye-witness that\\nthere is any sea on the further side of Europe. Nevertheless, tin\\nand amber do certainly come to us from the ends of the earth.\\n\\nThe northern parts of Europe are very much richer in gold than any\\nother region: but how it is procured I have no certain knowledge.\\nThe story runs that the one-eyed Arimaspi purloin it from the griffins;\\nbut here too I am incredulous, and cannot persuade myself that there\\nis a race of men born with one eye, who in all else resemble the rest\\nof mankind. Nevertheless it seems to be true that the extreme regions\\nof the earth, which surround and shut up within themselves all other\\ncountries, produce the things which are the rarest, and which men\\nreckon the most beautiful. \\n\\nThere is a plain in Asia which is shut in on all sides by a mountain-range,\\nand in this mountain-range are five openings. The plain lies on the\\nconfines of the Chorasmians, Hyrcanians, Parthians, Sarangians, and\\nThamanaeans, and belonged formerly to the first-mentioned of those\\npeoples. Ever since the Persians, however, obtained the mastery of\\nAsia, it has been the property of the Great King. A mighty river,\\ncalled the Aces, flows from the hills inclosing the plain; and this\\nstream, formerly splitting into five channels, ran through the five\\nopenings in the hills, and watered the lands of the five nations which\\ndwell around. The Persian came, however, and conquered the region,\\nand then it went ill with the people of these lands. The Great King\\nblocked up all the passages between the hills with dykes and flood\\ngates, and so prevented the water from flowing out. Then the plain\\nwithin the hills became a sea, for the river kept rising, and the\\nwater could find no outlet. From that time the five nations which\\nwere wont formerly to have the use of the stream, losing their accustomed\\nsupply of water, have been in great distress. In winter, indeed, they\\nhave rain from heaven like the rest of the world, but in summer, after\\nsowing their millet and their sesame, they always stand in need of\\nwater from the river. When, therefore, they suffer from this want,\\nhastening to Persia, men and women alike, they take their station\\nat the gate of the king\\'s palace, and wail aloud. Then the king orders\\nthe flood-gates to be opened towards the country whose need is greatest,\\nand lets the soil drink until it has had enough; after which the gates\\non this side are shut, and others are unclosed for the nation which,\\nof the remainder, needs it most. It has been told me that the king\\nnever gives the order to open the gates till the suppliants have paid\\nhim a large sum of money over and above the tribute. \\n\\nOf the seven Persians who rose up against the Magus, one, Intaphernes,\\nlost his life very shortly after the outbreak, for an act of insolence.\\nHe wished to enter the palace and transact a certain business with\\nthe king. Now the law was that all those who had taken part in the\\nrising against the Magus might enter unannounced into the king\\'s presence,\\nunless he happened to be in private with his wife. So Intaphernes\\nwould not have any one announce him, but, as he belonged to the seven,\\nclaimed it as his right to go in. The doorkeeper, however, and the\\nchief usher forbade his entrance, since the king, they said, was with\\nhis wife. But Intaphernes thought they told lies; so, drawing his\\nscymitar, he cut off their noses and their ears, and, hanging them\\non the bridle of his horse, put the bridle round their necks, and\\nso let them go. \\n\\nThen these two men went and showed themselves to the king, and told\\nhim how it had come to pass that they were thus treated. Darius trembled\\nlest it was by the common consent of the six that the deed had been\\ndone; he therefore sent for them all in turn, and sounded them to\\nknow if they approved the conduct of Intaphernes. When he found by\\ntheir answers that there had been no concert between him and them,\\nhe laid hands on Intaphernes, his children, and all his near kindred;\\nstrongly suspecting that he and his friends were about to raise a\\nrevolt. When all had been seized and put in chains, as malefactors\\ncondemned to death, the wife of Intaphernes came and stood continually\\nat the palace-gates, weeping and wailing sore. So Darius after a while,\\nseeing that she never ceased to stand and weep, was touched with pity\\nfor her, and bade a messenger go to her and say, \"Lady, king Darius\\ngives thee as a boon the life of one of thy kinsmen- choose which\\nthou wilt of the prisoners.\" Then she pondered awhile before she answered,\\n\"If the king grants me the life of one alone, I make choice of my\\nbrother.\" Darius, when he heard the reply, was astonished, and sent\\nagain, saying, \"Lady, the king bids thee tell him why it is that thou\\npassest by thy husband and thy children, and preferrest to have the\\nlife of thy brother spared. He is not so near to thee as thy children,\\nnor so dear as thy husband.\" She answered, \"O king, if the gods will,\\nI may have another husband and other children when these are gone.\\nBut as my father and my mother are no more, it is impossible that\\nI should have another brother. This was my thought when I asked to\\nhave my brother spared.\" Then it seemed to Darius that the lady spoke\\nwell, and he gave her, besides the life that she had asked, the life\\nalso of her eldest son, because he was greatly pleased with her. But\\nhe slew all the rest. Thus one of the seven died, in the way I have\\ndescribed, very shortly after the insurrection. \\n\\nAbout the time of Cambyses\\' last sickness, the following events happened.\\nThere was a certain Oroetes, a Persian, whom Cyrus had made governor\\nof Sardis. This man conceived a most unholy wish. He had never suffered\\nwrong or had an ill word from Polycrates the Samian- nay, he had not\\nso much as seen him in all his life; yet, notwithstanding, he conceived\\nthe wish to seize him and put him to death. This wish, according to\\nthe account which the most part give, arose from what happened one\\nday as he was sitting with another Persian in the gate of the king\\'s\\npalace. The man\\'s name was Mitrobates, and he was ruler of the satrapy\\nof Dascyleium. He and Oroetes had been talking together, and from\\ntalking they fell to quarrelling and comparing their merits; whereupon\\nMitrobates said to Oroetes reproachfully, \"Art thou worthy to be called\\na man, when, near as Samos lies to thy government, and easy as it\\nis to conquer, thou hast omitted to bring it under the dominion of\\nthe king? Easy to conquer, said I? Why, a mere common citizen, with\\nthe help of fifteen men-at-arms, mastered the island, and is still\\nking of it.\" Oroetes, they say, took this reproach greatly to heart;\\nbut, instead of seeking to revenge himself on the man by whom it was\\nuttered, he conceived the desire of destroying Polycrates, since it\\nwas on Polycrates\\' account that the reproach had fallen on him.\\n\\nAnother less common version of the story is that Oroetes sent a herald\\nto Samos to make a request, the nature of which is not stated; Polycrates\\nwas at the time reclining in the apartment of the males, and Anacreon\\nthe Teian was with him; when therefore the herald came forward to\\nconverse, Polycrates, either out of studied contempt for the power\\nof Oroetes, or it may be merely by chance, was lying with his face\\nturned away towards the wall; and so he lay all the time that the\\nherald spake, and when he ended, did not even vouchsafe him a word.\\n\\nSuch are the two reasons alleged for the death of Polycrates; it is\\nopen to all to believe which they please. What is certain is that\\nOroetes, while residing at Magnesia on the Maeander, sent a Lydian,\\nby name Myrsus, the son of Gyges, with a message to Polycrates at\\nSamos, well knowing what that monarch designed. For Polycrates entertained\\na design which no other Greek, so far as we know, ever formed before\\nhim, unless it were Minos the Cnossian, and those (if there were any\\nsuch) who had the mastery of the Egaean at an earlier time- Polycrates,\\nI say, was the first of mere human birth who conceived the design\\nof gaining the empire of the sea, and aspired to rule over Ionia and\\nthe islands. Knowing then that Polycrates was thus minded, Oroetes\\nsent his message, which ran as follows:- \\n\\n\"Oroetes to Polycrates thus sayeth: I hear thou raisest thy thoughts\\nhigh, but thy means are not equal to thy ambition. Listen then to\\nmy words, and learn how thou mayest at once serve thyself and preserve\\nme. King Cambyses is bent on my destruction- of this I have warning\\nfrom a sure hand. Come thou, therefore, and fetch me away, me and\\nall my wealth- share my wealth with me, and then, so far as money\\ncan aid, thou mayest make thyself master of the whole of Greece. But\\nif thou doubtest of my wealth, send the trustiest of thy followers,\\nand I will show my treasures to him.\" \\n\\nPolycrates, when he heard this message, was full of joy, and straightway\\napproved the terms; but, as money was what he chiefly desired, before\\nstirring in the business he sent his secretary, Maeandrius, son of\\nMaeandrius, a Samian, to look into the matter. This was the man who,\\nnot very long afterwards, made an offering at the temple of Juno of\\nall the furniture which had adorned the male apartments in the palace\\nof Polycrates, an offering well worth seeing. Oroetes learning that\\none was coming to view his treasures, contrived as follows:- he filled\\neight great chests almost brimful of stones, and then covering over\\nthe stones with gold, corded the chests, and so held them in readiness.\\nWhen Maeandrius arrived, he was shown this as Oroetes\\' treasure, and\\nhaving seen it returned to Samos. \\n\\nOn hearing his account, Polycrates, notwithstanding many warnings\\ngiven him by the soothsayers, and much dissuasion of his friends,\\nmade ready to go in person. Even the dream which visited his daughter\\nfailed to check him. She had dreamed that she saw her father hanging\\nhigh in air, washed by love, and anointed by the sun. Having therefore\\nthus dreamed, she used every effort to prevent her father from going;\\neven as he went on board his penteconter crying after him with words\\nof evil omen. Then Polycrates threatened her that, if he returned\\nin safety, he would keep her unmarried many years. She answered, \"Oh!\\nthat he might perform his threat; far better for her to remain long\\nunmarried than to be bereft of her father!\" \\n\\nPolycrates, however, making light of all the counsel offered him,\\nset sail and went to Oroetes. Many friends accompanied him; among\\nthe rest, Democedes, the son of Calliphon, a native of Crotona, who\\nwas a physician, and the best skilled in his art of all men then living.\\nPolycrates, on his arrival at Magnesia, perished miserably, in a way\\nunworthy of his rank and of his lofty schemes. For, if we except the\\nSyracusans, there has never been one of the Greek tyrants who was\\nto be compared with Polycrates for magnificence. Oroetes, however,\\nslew him in a mode which is not fit to be described, and then hung\\nhis dead body upon a cross. His Samian followers Oroetes let go free,\\nbidding them thank him that they were allowed their liberty; the rest,\\nwho were in part slaves, in part free foreigners, he alike treated\\nas his slaves by conquest. Then was the dream of the daughter of Polycrates\\nfulfilled; for Polycrates, as he hung upon the cross, and rain fell\\non him, was washed by Jupiter; and he was anointed by the sun, when\\nhis own moisture overspread his body. And so the vast good fortune\\nof Polycrates came at last to the end which Amasis the Egyptian king\\nhad prophesied in days gone by. \\n\\nIt was not long before retribution for the murder of Polycrates overtook\\nOroetes. After the death of Cambyses, and during all the time that\\nthe Magus sat upon the throne, Oroetes remained in Sardis, and brought\\nno help to the Persians, whom the Medes had robbed of the sovereignty.\\nOn the contrary, amid the troubles of this season, he slew Mitrobates,\\nthe satrap of Dascyleium, who had cast the reproach upon him in the\\nmatter of Polycrates; and he slew also Mitrobates\\'s son, Cranaspes-\\nboth men of high repute among the Persians. He was likewise guilty\\nof many other acts of insolence; among the rest, of the following:-\\nthere was a courier sent to him by Darius whose message was not to\\nhis mind- Oroetes had him waylaid and murdered on his road back to\\nthe king; the man and his horse both disappeared, and no traces were\\nleft of either. \\n\\nDarius therefore was no sooner settled upon the throne than he longed\\nto take vengeance upon Oroetes for all his misdoings, and especially\\nfor the murder of Mitrobates and his son. To send an armed force openly\\nagainst him, however, he did not think advisable, as the whole kingdom\\nwas still unsettled, and he too was but lately come to the throne,\\nwhile Oroetes, as he understood, had a great power. In truth a thousand\\nPersians attended on him as a bodyguard, and he held the satrapies\\nof Phrygia, Lydia, and Ionia. Darius therefore proceeded by artifice.\\nHe called together a meeting of all the chief of the Persians, and\\nthus addressed them:- \"Who among you, O Persians, will undertake to\\naccomplish me a matter by skill without force or tumult? Force is\\nmisplaced where the work wants skilful management. Who, then, will\\nundertake to bring me Oroetes alive, or else to kill him? He never\\ndid the Persians any good in his life, and he has wrought us abundant\\ninjury. Two of our number, Mitrobates and his son, he has slain; and\\nwhen messengers go to recall him, even though they have their mandate\\nfrom me, with an insolence which is not to be endured, he puts them\\nto death. We must kill this man, therefore, before he does the Persians\\nany greater hurt.\" \\n\\nThus spoke Darius; and straightway thirty of those present came forward\\nand offered themselves for the work. As they strove together, Darius\\ninterfered, and bade them have recourse to the lot. Accordingly lots\\nwere cast, and the task fell to Bagaeus, son of Artontes. Then Bagaeus\\ncaused many letters to be written on divers matters, and sealed them\\nall with the king\\'s signet; after which he took the letters with him,\\nand departed for Sardis. On his arrival he was shown into the presence\\nof Oroetes, when he uncovered the letters one by one, and giving them\\nto the king\\'s secretary- every satrap has with him a king\\'s secretary-\\ncommanded him to read their contents. Herein his design was to try\\nthe fidelity of the bodyguard, and to see if they would be likely\\nto fall away from Oroetes. When therefore he saw that they showed\\nthe letters all due respect, and even more highly reverenced their\\ncontents, he gave the secretary a paper in which was written, \"Persians,\\nking Darius forbids you to guard Oroetes.\" The soldiers at these words\\nlaid aside their spears. So Bagaeus, finding that they obeyed this\\nmandate, took courage, and gave into the secretary\\'s hands the last\\nletter, wherein it was written, \"King Darius commands the Persians\\nwho are in Sardis to kill Oroetes.\" Then the guards drew their swords\\nand slew him upon the spot. Thus did retribution for the murder of\\nPolycrates the Samian overtake Oroetes the Persian. \\n\\nSoon after the treasures of Oroetes had been conveyed to Sardis it\\nhappened that king Darius, as he leaped from his horse during the\\nchase, sprained his foot. The sprain was one of no common severity,\\nfor the ankle-bone was forced quite out of the socket. Now Darius\\nalready had at his court certain Egyptians whom he reckoned the best-skilled\\nphysicians in all the world; to their aid, therefore, he had recourse;\\nbut they twisted the foot so clumsily, and used such violence, that\\nthey only made the mischief greater. For seven days and seven nights\\nthe king lay without sleep, so grievous was the pain he suffered.\\nOn the eighth day of his indisposition, one who had heard before leaving\\nSardis of the skill of Democedes the Crotoniat, told Darius, who commanded\\nthat he should be brought with all speed into his presence. When,\\ntherefore, they had found him among the slaves of Oroetes, quite uncared\\nfor by any one, they brought him just as he was, clanking his fetters,\\nand all clothed in rags, before the king. \\n\\nAs soon as he was entered into the presence, Darius asked him if he\\nknew medicine- to which he answered \"No,\" for he feared that if he\\nmade himself known he would lose all chance of ever again beholding\\nGreece. Darius, however, perceiving that he dealt deceitfully, and\\nreally understood the art, bade those who had brought him to the presence\\ngo fetch the scourges and the pricking-irons. Upon this Democedes\\nmade confession, but at the same time said, that he had no thorough\\nknowledge of medicine- he had but lived some time with a physician,\\nand in this way had gained a slight smattering of the art. However,\\nDarius put himself under his care, and Democedes, by using the remedies\\ncustomary among the Greeks, and exchanging the violent treatment of\\nthe Egyptians for milder means, first enabled him to get some sleep,\\nand then in a very little time restored him altogether, after he had\\nquite lost the hope of ever having the use of his foot. Hereupon the\\nking presented Democedes with two sets of fetters wrought in gold;\\nso Democedes asked if he meant to double his sufferings because he\\nhad brought him back to health? Darius was pleased at the speech,\\nand bade the eunuchs take Democedes to see his wives, which they did\\naccordingly, telling them all that this was the man who had saved\\nthe king\\'s life. Then each of the wives dipped with a saucer into\\na chest of gold, and gave so bountifully to Democedes, that a slave\\nnamed Sciton, who followed him, and picked up the staters which fell\\nfrom the saucers, gathered together a great heap of gold.\\n\\nThis Democedes left his country and became attached to Polycrates\\nin the following way:- His father, who dwelt at Crotona, was a man\\nof a savage temper, and treated him cruelly. When, therefore, he could\\nno longer bear such constant ill-usage, Democedes left his home, and\\nsailed away to Egina. There he set up in business, and succeeded the\\nfirst year in surpassing all the best-skilled physicians of the place,\\nnotwithstanding that he was without instruments, and had with him\\nnone of the appliances needful for the practice of his art. In the\\nsecond year the state of Egina hired his services at the price of\\na talent; in the third the Athenians engaged him at a hundred minae;\\nand in the fourth Polycrates at two talents. So he went to Samos,\\nand there took up his abode. It was in no small measure from his success\\nthat the Crotoniats came to be reckoned such good physicians; for\\nabout this period the physicians of Crotona had the name of being\\nthe best, and those of Cyrene the second best, in all Greece. The\\nArgives, about the same time, were thought to be the first musicians\\nin Greece. \\n\\nAfter Democedes had cured Darius at Susa, he dwelt there in a large\\nhouse, and feasted daily at the king\\'s table, nor did he lack anything\\nthat his heart desired, excepting liberty to return to his country.\\nBy interceding for them with Darius, he saved the lives of the Egyptian\\nphysicians who had had the care of the king before he came, when they\\nwere about to be impaled because they had been surpassed by a Greek;\\nand further, he succeeded in rescuing an Elean soothsayer, who had\\nfollowed the fortunes of Polycrates, and was lying in utter neglect\\namong his slaves. In short there was no one who stood so high as Democedes\\nin the favour of the king. \\n\\nMoreover, within a little while it happened that Atossa, the daughter\\nof Cyrus, who was married to Darius, had a boil form upon her breast,\\nwhich, after it burst, began to spread and increase. Now so long as\\nthe sore was of no great size, she hid it through shame and made no\\nmention of it to any one; but when it became worse, she sent at last\\nfor Democedes, and showed it to him. Democedes said that he would\\nmake her well, but she must first promise him with an oath that if\\nhe cured her she would grant him whatever request he might prefer;\\nassuring her at the same time that it should be nothing which she\\ncould blush to hear. \\n\\nOn these terms Democedes applied his art, and soon cured the abscess;\\nand Atossa, when she had heard his request, spake thus one night to\\nDarius:- \\n\\n\"It seemeth to me strange, my lord, that, with the mighty power which\\nis thine, thou sittest idle, and neither makest any conquest, nor\\nadvancest the power of the Persians. Methinks that one who is so young,\\nand so richly endowed with wealth, should perform some noble achievement\\nto prove to the Persians that it is a man who governs them. Another\\nreason, too, should urge thee to attempt some enterprise. Not only\\ndoes it befit thee to show the Persians that a man rules them, but\\nfor thy own peace thou shouldest waste their strength in wars lest\\nidleness breed revolt against thy authority. Now, too, whilst thou\\nart still young, thou mayest well accomplish some exploit; for as\\nthe body grows in strength the mind too ripens, and as the body ages,\\nthe mind\\'s powers decay, till at last it becomes dulled to everything.\"\\n\\nSo spake Atossa, as Democedes had instructed her. Darius answered:-\\n\"Dear lady, thou hast uttered the very thoughts that occupy my brain.\\nI am minded to construct a bridge which shall join our continent with\\nthe other, and so carry war into Scythia. Yet a brief space and all\\nwill be accomplished as thou desirest.\" \\n\\nBut Atossa rejoined:- \"Look now, this war with Scythia were best reserved\\nawhile- for the Scythians may be conquered at any time. Prithee, lead\\nme thy host first into Greece. I long to be served by some of those\\nLacedaemonian maids of whom I have heard so much. I want also Argive,\\nand Athenian, and Corinthian women. There is now at the court a man\\nwho can tell thee better than any one else in the whole world whatever\\nthou wouldst know concerning Greece, and who might serve thee right\\nwell as guide; I mean him who performed the cure on thy foot.\"\\n\\n\"Dear lady,\" Darius answered, \"since it is thy wish that we try first\\nthe valour of the Greeks, it were best, methinks, before marching\\nagainst them, to send some Persians to spy out the land; they may\\ngo in company with the man thou mentionest, and when they have seen\\nand learnt all, they can bring us back a full report. Then, having\\na more perfect knowledge of them, I will begin the war.\"\\n\\nDarius, having so spoke, put no long distance between the word and\\nthe deed, but as soon as day broke he summoned to his presence fifteen\\nPersians of note, and bade them take Democedes for their guide, and\\nexplore the sea-coasts of Greece. Above all, they were to be sure\\nto bring Democedes back with them, and not suffer him to run away\\nand escape. After he had given these orders, Darius sent for Democedes,\\nand besought him to serve as guide to the Persians, and when he had\\nshown them the whole of Greece to come back to Persia. He should take,\\nhe said, all the valuables he possessed as presents to his father\\nand his brothers, and he should receive on his return a far more abundant\\nstore. Moreover, the king added, he would give him, as his contribution\\ntowards the presents, a merchantship laden with all manner of precious\\nthings, which should accompany him on his voyage. Now I do not believe\\nthat Darius, when he made these promises, had any guile in his heart:\\nDemocedes, however, who suspected that the king spoke to try him,\\ntook care not to snatch at the offers with any haste; but said, \"he\\nwould leave his own goods behind to enjoy upon his return- the merchant-ship\\nwhich the king proposed to grant him to carry gifts to his brothers,\\nthat he would accept at the king\\'s hands.\" So when Darius had laid\\nhis orders upon Democedes, he sent him and the Persians away to the\\ncoast. \\n\\nThe men went down to Phoenicia, to Sidon, the Phoenician town, where\\nstraightway they fitted out two triremes and a trading-vessel, which\\nthey loaded with all manner of precious merchandise; and, everything\\nbeing now ready, they set sail for Greece. When they had made the\\nland, they kept along the shore and examined it, taking notes of all\\nthat they saw; and in this way they explored the greater portion of\\nthe country, and all the most famous regions, until at last they reached\\nTarentum in Italy. There Aristophilides, king of the Tarentines, out\\nof kindness to Democedes, took the rudders off the Median ships, and\\ndetained their crews as spies. Meanwhile Democedes escaped to Crotona,\\nhis native city, whereupon Aristophilides released the Persians from\\nprison, and gave their rudders back to them. \\n\\nThe Persians now quitted Tarentum, and sailed to Crotona in pursuit\\nof Democedes; they found him in the market-place, where they straightway\\nlaid violent hands on him. Some of the Crotoniats, who greatly feared\\nthe power of the Persians, were willing to give him up; but others\\nresisted, held Democedes fast, and even struck the Persians with their\\nwalking-sticks. They, on their part, kept crying out, \"Men of Crotona,\\nbeware what you do. It is the king\\'s runaway slave that you are rescuing.\\nThink you Darius will tamely submit to such an insult? Think you,\\nthat if you carry off the man from us, it will hereafter go well with\\nyou? Will you not rather be the first persons on whom we shall make\\nwar? Will not your city be the first we shall seek to lead away captive?\"\\nThus they spake, but the Crotoniats did not heed them; they rescued\\nDemocedes, and seized also the trading-ship which the Persians had\\nbrought with them from Phoenicia. Thus robbed, and bereft of their\\nguide, the Persians gave up all hope of exploring the rest of Greece,\\nand set sail for Asia. As they were departing, Democedes sent to them\\nand begged they would inform Darius that the daughter of Milo was\\nallianced to him as his bride. For the name of Milo the wrestler was\\nin high repute with the king. My belief is, that Democedes hastened\\nhis marriage by the payment of a large sum of money for the purpose\\nof showing Darius that he was a man of mark in his own country.\\n\\nThe Persians weighed anchor and left Crotona, but, being wrecked on\\nthe coast of Iapygia, were made slaves by the inhabitants. From this\\ncondition they were rescued by Gillus, a banished Tarentine, who ransomed\\nthem at his own cost, and took them back to Darius. Darius offered\\nto repay this service by granting Gillus whatever boon he chose to\\nask; whereupon Gillus told the king of his misfortune, and begged\\nto be restored to his country. Fearing, however, that he might bring\\ntrouble on Greece if a vast armament were sent to Italy on his account,\\nhe added that it would content him if the Cnidians undertook to obtain\\nhis recall. Now the Cnidians were dose friends of the Tarentines,\\nwhich made him think there was no likelier means of procuring his\\nreturn. Darius promised and performed his part; for he sent messenger\\nto Cnidus, and commanded the Cnidians to restore Gillus. The Cnidians\\ndid as he wished, but found themselves unable to persuade the Tarentines,\\nand were too weak to attempt force. Such then was the course which\\nthis matter took. These were the first Persians who ever came from\\nAsia to Greece; and they were sent to spy out the land for the reason\\nwhich I have before mentioned. \\n\\nAfter this, king Darius besieged and took Samos, which was the first\\ncity, Greek or Barbarian, that he conquered. The cause of his making\\nwar upon Samos was the following:- at the time when Cambyses, son\\nof Cyrus, marched against Egypt, vast numbers of Greeks flocked thither;\\nsome, as might have been looked for, to push their trade; others,\\nto serve in his army; others again, merely to see the land: among\\nthese last was Syloson, son of Aeaces, and brother of Polycrates,\\nat that time an exile from Samos. This Syloson, during his stay in\\nEgypt, met with a singular piece of good fortune. He happened one\\nday to put on a scarlet cloak, and thus attired to go into the market-place\\nat Memphis, when Dariuss who was one of Cambyses\\' bodyguard, and not\\nat that time a man of any account, saw him, and taking a strong liking\\nto the dress, went up and offered to purchase it. Syloson perceived\\nhow anxious he was, and by a lucky inspiration answered: \"There is\\nno price at which I would sell my cloak; but I will give it thee for\\nnothing, if it must needs be thine.\" Darius thanked him, and accepted\\nthe garment. \\n\\nPoor Syloson felt at the time that he had fooled away his cloak in\\na very simple manner; but afterwards, when in the course of years\\nCambyses died, and the seven Persians rose in revolt against the Magus,\\nand Darius was the man chosen out of the seven to have the kingdom,\\nSyloson learnt that the person to whom the crown had come was the\\nvery man who had coveted his cloak in Egypt, and to whom he had freely\\ngiven it. So he made his way to Susa, and seating himself at the portal\\nof the royal palace, gave out that he was a benefactor of the king.\\nThen the doorkeeper went and told Darius. Amazed at what he heard,\\nking said thus within himself:- \"What Greek can have been my benefactor,\\nor to which of them do I owe anything, so lately as I have got the\\nkingdom? Scarcely a man of them all has been here, not more than one\\nor two certainly, since I came to the throne. Nor do I remember that\\nI am in the debt of any Greek. However, bring him in, and let me hear\\nwhat he means by his boast.\" So the doorkeeper ushered Syloson into\\nthe presence, and the interpreters asked him who he was, and what\\nhe had done that he should call himself a benefactor of the king.\\nThen Syloson told the whole story of the cloak, and said that it was\\nhe who had made Darius the present. Hereupon Darius exclaimed, \"Oh!\\nthou most generous of men, art thou indeed he who, when I had no power\\nat all, gavest me something, albeit little? Truly the favour is as\\ngreat as a very grand present would be nowadays. I will therefore\\ngive thee in return gold and silver without stint, that thou mayest\\nnever repent of having rendered a service to Darius, son of Hystaspes.\\n\"Give me not, O king,\" replied Syloson, \"either silver or gold, but\\nrecover me Samos, my native land, and let that be thy gift to me.\\nIt belongs now to a slave of ours, who, when Oroetes put my brother\\nPolycrates to death, became its master. Give me Samos, I beg; but\\ngive it unharmed, with no bloodshed- no leading into captivity.\"\\n\\nWhen he heard this, Darius sent off an army, under Otanes, one of\\nthe seven, with orders to accomplish all that Syloson had desired.\\nAnd Otanes went down to the coast and made ready to cross over.\\n\\nThe government of Samos was held at this time by Maeandrius, son of\\nMaeandrius, whom Polycrates had appointed as his deputy. This person\\nconceived the wish to act like the justest of men, but it was not\\nallowed him to do so. On receiving tidings of the death of Polycrates,\\nhe forthwith raised an altar to love the Protector of Freedom, and\\nassigned it the piece of ground which may still be seen in the suburb.\\nThis done, he assembled all the citizens, and spoke to them as follows:-\\n\\n\"Ye know, friends, that the sceptre of Polycrates, and all his power,\\nhas passed into my hands, and if I choose I may rule over you. But\\nwhat I condemn in another I will, if I may, avoid myself. I never\\napproved the ambition of Polycrates to lord it over men as good as\\nhimself, nor looked with favour on any of those who have done the\\nlike. Now therefore, since he has fulfilled his destiny, I lay down\\nmy office, and proclaim equal rights. All that I claim in return is\\nsix talents from the treasures of Polycrates, and the priesthood of\\nJove the Protector of Freedom, for myself and my descendants for ever.\\nAllow me this, as the man by whom his temple has been built, and by\\nwhom ye yourselves are now restored to liberty.\" As soon as Maeandrius\\nhad ended, one of the Samians rose up and said, \"As if thou wert fit\\nto rule us, base-born and rascal as thou art! Think rather of accounting\\nfor the monies which thou hast fingered.\" \\n\\nThe man who thus spoke was a certain Telesarchus, one of the leading\\ncitizens. Maeandrius, therefore, feeling sure that if he laid down\\nthe sovereign power some one else would become tyrant in his room,\\ngave up the thought of relinquishing it. Withdrawing to the citadel,\\nhe sent for the chief men one by one, under pretence of showing them\\nhis accounts, and as fast as they came arrested them and put them\\nin irons. So these men were bound; and Maeandrius within a short time\\nfell sick: whereupon Lycaretus, one of his brothers, thinking that\\nhe was going to die, and wishing to make his own accession to the\\nthrone the easier, slew all the prisoners. It seemed that the Samians\\ndid not choose to be a free people. \\n\\nWhen the Persians whose business it was to restore Syloson reached\\nSamos, not a man was found to lift up his hand against them. Maeandrius\\nand his partisans expressed themselves willing to quit the island\\nupon certain terms, and these terms were agreed to by Otanes. After\\nthe treaty was made, the most distinguished of the Persians had their\\nthrones brought, and seated themselves over against the citadel.\\n\\nNow the king Maeandrius had a lightheaded brother- Charilaus by name-\\nwhom for some offence or other he had shut up in prison: this man\\nheard what was going on, and peering through his bars, saw the Persians\\nsitting peacefully upon their seats, whereupon he exclaimed aloud,\\nand said he must speak with Maeandrius. When this was reported to\\nhim, Maeandrius gave orders that Charilaus should be released from\\nprison and brought into his presence. No sooner did he arrive than\\nhe began reviling and abusing his brother, and strove to persuade\\nhim to attack the Persians. \"Thou meanest-spirited of men,\" he said,\\n\"thou canst keep me, thy brother, chained in a dungeon, notwithstanding\\nthat I have done nothing worthy of bonds; but when the Persians come\\nand drive thee forth a houseless wanderer from thy native land, thou\\nlookest on, and hast not the heart to seek revenge, though they might\\nso easily be subdued. If thou, however, art afraid, lend me thy soldiers,\\nand I will make them pay dearly for their coming here. I engage too\\nto send thee first safe out of the island.\" \\n\\nSo spake Charilaus, and Maeandrius gave consent; not (I believe) that\\nhe was so void of sense as to imagine that his own forces could overcome\\nthose of the king, but because he was jealous of Syloson, and did\\nnot wish him to get so quietly an unharmed city. He desired therefore\\nto rouse the anger of the Persians against Samos, that so he might\\ndeliver it up to Syloson with its power at the lowest possible ebb;\\nfor he knew well that if the Persians met with a disaster they would\\nbe furious against the Samians, while he himself felt secure of a\\nretreat at any time that he liked, since he had a secret passage under\\nground leading from the citadel to the sea. Maeandrius accordingly\\ntook ship and sailed away from Samos; and Charilaus, having armed\\nall the mercenaries, threw open the gates, and fell upon the Persians,\\nwho looked for nothing less, since they supposed that the whole matter\\nhad been arranged by treaty. At the first onslaught therefore all\\nthe Persians of most note, men who were in the habit of using litters,\\nwere slain by the mercenaries; the rest of the army, however, came\\nto the rescue, defeated the mercenaries, and drove them back into\\nthe citadel. \\n\\nThen Otanes, the general, when he saw the great calamity which had\\nbefallen the Persians, made up his mind to forget the orders which\\nDarius had given him, \"not to kill or enslave a single Samian, but\\nto deliver up the island unharmed to Syloson,\" and gave the word to\\nhis army that they should slay the Samians, both men and boys, wherever\\nthey could find them. Upon this some of his troops laid siege to the\\ncitadel, while others began the massacre, killing all they met, some\\noutside, some inside the temples. \\n\\nMaeandrius fled from Samos to Lacedaemon, and conveyed thither all\\nthe riches which he had brought away from the island, after which\\nhe acted as follows. Having placed upon his board all the gold and\\nsilver vessels that he had, and bade his servants employ themselves\\nin cleaning them, he himself went and entered into conversation with\\nCleomenes, son of Anaxandridas, king of Sparta, and as they talked\\nbrought him along to his house. There Cleomenes, seeing the plate,\\nwas filled with wonder and astonishment; whereon the other begged\\nthat he would carry home with him any of the vessels that he liked.\\nMaeandrius said this two or three times; but Cleomenes here displayed\\nsurpassing honesty. He refused the gift, and thinking that if Maeandrius\\nmade the same offers to others he would get the aid he sought, the\\nSpartan king went straight to the ephors and told them \"it would be\\nbest for Sparta that the Samian stranger should be sent away from\\nthe Peloponnese; for otherwise he might perchance persuade himself\\nor some other Spartan to be base.\" The ephors took his advice, and\\nlet Maeandrius know by a herald that he must leave the city.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Persians netted Samos, and delivered it up to Syloson,\\nstripped of all its men. After some time, however, this same general\\nOtanes was induced to repeople it by a dream which he had, and a loathsome\\ndisease that seized on him. \\n\\nAfter the armament of Otanes had set sail for Samos, the Babylonians\\nrevolted, having made every preparation for defence. During all the\\ntime that the Magus was king, and while the seven were conspiring,\\nthey had profited by the troubles, and had made themselves ready against\\na siege. And it happened somehow or other that no one perceived what\\nthey were doing. At last when the time came for rebelling openly,\\nthey did as follows:- having first set apart their mothers, each man\\nchose besides out of his whole household one woman, whomsoever he\\npleased; these alone were allowed to live, while all the rest were\\nbrought to one place and strangled. The women chosen were kept to\\nmake bread for the men; while the others were strangled that they\\nmight not consume the stores. \\n\\nWhen tidings reached Darius of what had happened, he drew together\\nall his power, and began the war by marching straight upon Babylon,\\nand laying siege to the place. The Babylonians, however, cared not\\na whit for his siege. Mounting upon the battlements that crowned their\\nwalls, they insulted and jeered at Darius and his mighty host. One\\neven shouted to them and said, \"Why sit ye there, Persians? why do\\nye not go back to your homes? Till mules foal ye will not take our\\ncity.\" This was by a Babylonian who thought that a mule would never\\nfoal. \\n\\nNow when a year and seven months had passed, Darius and his army were\\nquite wearied out, finding that they could not anyhow take the city.\\nAll stratagems and all arts had been used, and yet the king could\\nnot prevail- not even when he tried the means by which Cyrus made\\nhimself master of the place. The Babylonians were ever upon the watch,\\nand he found no way of conquering them. \\n\\nAt last, in the twentieth month, a marvellous thing happened to Zopyrus,\\nson of the Megabyzus who was among the seven men that overthrew the\\nMagus. One of his sumpter-mules gave birth to a foal. Zopyrus, when\\nthey told him, not thinking that it could be true, went and saw the\\ncolt with his own eyes; after which he commanded his servants to tell\\nno one what had come to pass, while he himself pondered the matter.\\nCalling to mind then the words of the Babylonian at the beginning\\nof the siege, \"Till mules foal ye shall not take our city\"- he thought,\\nas he reflected on this speech, that Babylon might now be taken. For\\nit seemed to him that there was a Divine Providence in the man having\\nused the phrase, and then his mule having foaled. \\n\\nAs soon therefore as he felt within himself that Babylon was fated\\nto be taken, he went to Darius and asked him if he set a very high\\nvalue on its conquest. When he found that Darius did indeed value\\nit highly, he considered further with himself how he might make the\\ndeed his own, and be the man to take Babylon. Noble exploits in Persia\\nare ever highly honoured and bring their authors to greatness. He\\ntherefore reviewed all ways of bringing the city under, but found\\nnone by which he could hope to prevail, unless he maimed himself and\\nthen went over to the enemy. To do this seeming to him a light matter,\\nhe mutilated himself in a way that was utterly without remedy. For\\nhe cut off his own nose and ears, and then, clipping his hair close\\nand flogging himself with a scourge, he came in this plight before\\nDarius. \\n\\nWrath stirred within the king at the sight of a man of his lofty rank\\nin such a condition; leaping down from his throne, he exclaimed aloud,\\nand asked Zopyrus who it was that had disfigured him, and what he\\nhad done to be so treated. Zopyrus answered, \"There is not a man in\\nthe world, but thou, O king, that could reduce me to such a plight-\\nno stranger\\'s hands have wrought this work on me, but my own only.\\nI maimed myself I could not endure that the Assyrians should laugh\\nat the Persians.\" \"Wretched man,\" said Darius, \"thou coverest the\\nfoulest deed with the fairest possible name, when thou sayest thy\\nmaiming is to help our siege forward. How will thy disfigurement,\\nthou simpleton, induce the enemy to yield one day the sooner? Surely\\nthou hadst gone out of thy mind when thou didst so misuse thyself.\"\\n\"Had I told thee,\" rejoined the other, \"what I was bent on doing,\\nthou wouldest not have suffered it; as it is, I kept my own counsel,\\nand so accomplished my plans. Now, therefore, if there be no failure\\non thy part, we shall take Babylon. I will desert to the enemy as\\nI am, and when I get into their city I will tell them that it is by\\nthee I have been thus treated. I think they will believe my words,\\nand entrust me with a command of troops. Thou, on thy part, must wait\\ntill the tenth day after I am entered within the town, and then place\\nnear to the gates of Semiramis a detachment of thy army, troops for\\nwhose loss thou wilt care little, a thousand men. Wait, after that,\\nseven days, and post me another detachment, two thousand strong, at\\nthe Nineveh gates; then let twenty days pass, and at the end of that\\ntime station near the Chaldaean gates a body of four thousand. Let\\nneither these nor the former troops be armed with any weapons but\\ntheir swords- those thou mayest leave them. After the twenty days\\nare over, bid thy whole army attack the city on every side, and put\\nme two bodies of Persians, one at the Belian, the other at the Cissian\\ngates; for I expect, that, on account of my successes, the Babylonians\\nwill entrust everything, even the keys of their gates, to me. Then\\nit will be for me and my Persians to do the rest.\" \\n\\nHaving left these instructions, Zopyrus fled towards the gates of\\nthe town, often looking back, to give himself the air of a deserter.\\nThe men upon the towers, whose business it was to keep a lookout,\\nobserving him, hastened down, and setting one of the gates slightly\\najar, questioned him who he was, and on what errand he had come. He\\nreplied that he was Zopyrus, and had deserted to them from the Persians.\\nThen the doorkeepers, when they heard this, carried him at once before\\nthe Magistrates. Introduced into the assembly, he began to bewail\\nhis misfortunes, telling them that Darius had maltreated him in the\\nway they could see, only because he had given advice that the siege\\nshould be raised, since there seemed no hope of taking the city. \"And\\nnow,\" he went on to say, \"my coming to you, Babylonians, will prove\\nthe greatest gain that you could possibly receive, while to Darius\\nand the Persians it will be the severest loss. Verily he by whom I\\nhave been so mutilated shall not escape unpunished. And truly all\\nthe paths of his counsels are known to me.\" Thus did Zopyrus speak.\\n\\nThe Babylonians, seeing a Persian of such exalted rank in so grievous\\na plight, his nose and ears cut off, his body red with marks of scourging\\nand with blood, had no suspicion but that he spoke the truth, and\\nwas really come to be their friend and helper. They were ready, therefore,\\nto grant him anything that he asked; and on his suing for a command,\\nthey entrusted to him a body of troops, with the help of which he\\nproceeded to do as he had arranged with Darius. On the tenth day after\\nhis flight he led out his detachment, and surrounding the thousand\\nmen, whom Darius according to agreement had sent first, he fell upon\\nthem and slew them all. Then the Babylonians, seeing that his deeds\\nwere as brave as his words, were beyond measure pleased, and set no\\nbounds to their trust. He waited, however, and when the next period\\nagreed on had elapsed, again with a band of picked men he sallied\\nforth, and slaughtered the two thousand. After this second exploit,\\nhis praise was in all mouths. Once more, however, he waited till the\\ninterval appointed had gone by, and then leading the troops to the\\nplace where the four thousand were, he put them also to the sword.\\nThis last victory gave the finishing stroke to his power, and made\\nhim all in all with the Babylonians: accordingly they committed to\\nhim the command of their whole army, and put the keys of their city\\ninto his hands. \\n\\nDarius now, still keeping to the plan agreed upon, attacked the walls\\non every side, whereupon Zopyrus played out the remainder of his stratagem.\\nWhile the Babylonians, crowding to the walls, did their best to resist\\nthe Persian assault, he threw open the Cissian and the Belian gates,\\nand admitted the enemy. Such of the Babylonians as witnessed the treachery,\\ntook refuge in the temple of Jupiter Belus; the rest, who did not\\nsee it, kept at their posts, till at last they too learnt that they\\nwere betrayed. \\n\\nThus was Babylon taken for the second time. Darius having become master\\nof the place, destroyed the wall, and tore down all the gates; for\\nCyrus had done neither the one nor the other when he took Babylon.\\nHe then chose out near three thousand of the leading citizens, and\\ncaused them to be crucified, while he allowed the remainder still\\nto inhabit the city. Further, wishing to prevent the race of the Babylonians\\nfrom becoming extinct, he provided wives for them in the room of those\\nwhom (as I explained before) they strangled, to save their stores.\\nThese he levied from the nations bordering on Babylonia, who were\\neach required to send so large a number to Babylon, that in all there\\nwere collected no fewer than fifty thousand. It is from these women\\nthat the Babylonians of our times are sprung. \\n\\nAs for Zopyrus, he was considered by Darius to have surpassed, in\\nthe greatness of his achievements, all other Persians, whether of\\nformer or of later times, except only Cyrus- with whom no Persian\\never yet thought himself worthy to compare. Darius, as the story goes,\\nwould often say that \"he had rather Zopyrus were unmaimed, than be\\nmaster of twenty more Babylons.\" And he honoured Zopyrus greatly;\\nyear by year he presented him with all the gifts which are held in\\nmost esteem among the Persians; he gave him likewise the government\\nof Babylon for his life, free from tribute; and he also granted him\\nmany other favours. Megabyzus, who held the command in Egypt against\\nthe Athenians and their allies, was a son of this Zopyrus. And Zopyrus,\\nwho fled from Persia to Athens, was a son of this Megabyzus.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK IV\\n\\nMelpomene \\n\\nAfter the taking of Babylon, an expedition was led by Darius into\\nScythia. Asia abounding in men, and vast sums flowing into the treasury,\\nthe desire seized him to exact vengeance from the Scyths, who had\\nonce in days gone by invaded Media, defeated those who met them in\\nthe field, and so begun the quarrel. During the space of eight-and-twenty\\nyears, as I have before mentioned, the Scyths continued lords of the\\nwhole of Upper Asia. They entered Asia in pursuit of the Cimmerians,\\nand overthrew the empire of the Medes, who till they came possessed\\nthe sovereignty. On their return to their homes after the long absence\\nof twenty-eight years, a task awaited them little less troublesome\\nthan their struggle with the Medes. They found an army of no small\\nsize prepared to oppose their entrance. For the Scythian women, when\\nthey saw that time went on, and their husbands did not come back,\\nhad intermarried with their slaves. \\n\\nNow the Scythians blind all their slaves, to use them in preparing\\ntheir milk. The plan they follow is to thrust tubes made of bone,\\nnot unlike our musical pipes, up the vulva of the mare, and then to\\nblow into the tubes with their mouths, some milking while the others\\nblow. They say that they do this because when the veins of the animal\\nare full of air, the udder is forced down. The milk thus obtained\\nis poured into deep wooden casks, about which the blind slaves are\\nplaced, and then the milk is stirred round. That which rises to the\\ntop is drawn off, and considered the best part; the under portion\\nis of less account. Such is the reason why the Scythians blind all\\nthose whom they take in war; it arises from their not being tillers\\nof the ground, but a pastoral race. \\n\\nWhen therefore the children sprung from these slaves and the Scythian\\nwomen grew to manhood, and understood the circumstances of their birth,\\nthey resolved to oppose the army which was returning from Media. And,\\nfirst of all, they cut off a tract of country from the rest of Scythia\\nby digging a broad dyke from the Tauric mountains to the vast lake\\nof the Maeotis. Afterwards, when the Scythians tried to force an entrance,\\nthey marched out and engaged them. Many battles were fought, and the\\nScythians gained no advantage, until at last one of them thus addressed\\nthe remainder: \"What are we doing, Scythians? We are fighting our\\nslaves, diminishing our own number when we fall, and the number of\\nthose that belong to us when they fall by our hands. Take my advice-\\nlay spear and bow aside, and let each man fetch his horsewhip, and\\ngo boldly up to them. So long as they see us with arms in our hands,\\nthey imagine themselves our equals in birth and bravery; but let them\\nbehold us with no other weapon but the whip, and they will feel that\\nthey are our slaves, and flee before us.\" \\n\\nThe Scythians followed this counsel, and the slaves were so astounded,\\nthat they forgot to fight, and immediately ran away. Such was the\\nmode in which the Scythians, after being for a time the lords of Asia,\\nand being forced to quit it by the Medes, returned and settled in\\ntheir own country. This inroad of theirs it was that Darius was anxious\\nto avenge, and such was the purpose for which he was now collecting\\nan army to invade them. \\n\\nAccording to the account which the Scythians themselves give, they\\nare the youngest of all nations. Their tradition is as follows. A\\ncertain Targitaus was the first man who ever lived in their country,\\nwhich before his time was a desert without inhabitants. He was a child-\\nI do not believe the tale, but it is told nevertheless- of Jove and\\na daughter of the Borysthenes. Targitaus, thus descended, begat three\\nsons, Leipoxais, Arpoxais, and Colaxais, who was the youngest born\\nof the three. While they still ruled the land, there fell from the\\nsky four implements, all of gold- a plough, a yoke, a battle-axe,\\nand a drinking-cup. The eldest of the brothers perceived them first,\\nand approached to pick them up; when lo! as he came near, the gold\\ntook fire, and blazed. He therefore went his way, and the second coming\\nforward made the attempt, but the same thing happened again. The gold\\nrejected both the eldest and the second brother. Last of all the youngest\\nbrother approached, and immediately the flames were extinguished;\\nso he picked up the gold, and carried it to his home. Then the two\\nelder agreed together, and made the whole kingdom over to the youngest\\nborn. \\n\\nFrom Leipoxais sprang the Scythians of the race called Auchatae; from\\nArpoxais, the middle brother, those known as the Catiari and Traspians;\\nfrom Colaxais, the youngest, the Royal Scythians, or Paralatae. All\\ntogether they are named Scoloti, after one of their kings: the Greeks,\\nhowever, call them Scythians. \\n\\nSuch is the account which the Scythians give of their origin. They\\nadd that from the time of Targitaus, their first king, to the invasion\\nof their country by Darius, is a period of one thousand years, neither\\nless nor more. The Royal Scythians guard the sacred gold with most\\nespecial care, and year by year offer great sacrifices in its honour.\\nAt this feast, if the man who has the custody of the gold should fall\\nasleep in the open air, he is sure (the Scythians say) not to outlive\\nthe year. His pay therefore is as much land as he can ride round on\\nhorseback in a day. As the extent of Scythia is very great, Colaxais\\ngave each of his three sons a separate kingdom, one of which was of\\nampler size than the other two: in this the gold was preserved. Above,\\nto the northward of the farthest dwellers in Scythia, the country\\nis said to be concealed from sight and made impassable by reason of\\nthe feathers which are shed abroad abundantly. The earth and air are\\nalike full of them, and this it is which prevents the eye from obtaining\\nany view of the region. \\n\\nSuch is the account which the Scythians give of themselves, and of\\nthe country which lies above them. The Greeks who dwell about the\\nPontus tell a different story. According to Hercules, when he was\\ncarrying off the cows of Geryon, arrived in the region which is now\\ninhabited by the Scyths, but which was then a desert. Geryon lived\\noutside the Pontus, in an island called by the Greeks Erytheia, near\\nGades, which is beyond the Pillars of Hercules upon the Ocean. Now\\nsome say that the Ocean begins in the east, and runs the whole way\\nround the world; but they give no proof that this is really so. Hercules\\ncame from thence into the region now called Scythia, and, being overtaken\\nby storm and frost, drew his lion\\'s skin about him, and fell fast\\nasleep. While he slept, his mares, which he had loosed from his chariot\\nto graze, by some wonderful chance disappeared. \\n\\nOn waking, he went in quest of them, and, after wandering over the\\nwhole country, came at last to the district called \"the Woodland,\"\\nwhere he found in a cave a strange being, between a maiden and a serpent,\\nwhose form from the waist upwards was like that of a woman, while\\nall below was like a snake. He looked at her wonderingly; but nevertheless\\ninquired, whether she had chanced to see his strayed mares anywhere.\\nShe answered him, \"Yes, and they were now in her keeping; but never\\nwould she consent to give them back, unless he took her for his mistress.\"\\nSo Hercules, to get his mares back, agreed; but afterwards she put\\nhim off and delayed restoring the mares, since she wished to keep\\nhim with her as long as possible. He, on the other hand, was only\\nanxious to secure them and to get away. At last, when she gave them\\nup, she said to him, \"When thy mares strayed hither, it was I who\\nsaved them for thee: now thou hast paid their salvage; for lo! I bear\\nin my womb three sons of thine. Tell me therefore when thy sons grow\\nup, what must I do with them? Wouldst thou wish that I should settle\\nthem here in this land, whereof I am mistress, or shall I send them\\nto thee?\" Thus questioned, they say, Hercules answered, \"When the\\nlads have grown to manhood, do thus, and assuredly thou wilt not err.\\nWatch them, and when thou seest one of them bend this bow as I now\\nbend it, and gird himself with this girdle thus, choose him to remain\\nin the land. Those who fail in the trial, send away. Thus wilt thou\\nat once please thyself and obey me.\" \\n\\nHereupon he strung one of his bows- up to that time he had carried\\ntwo- and showed her how to fasten the belt. Then he gave both bow\\nand belt into her hands. Now the belt had a golden goblet attached\\nto its clasp. So after he had given them to her, he went his way;\\nand the woman, when her children grew to manhood, first gave them\\nseverally their names. One she called Agathyrsus, one Gelonus, and\\nthe other, who was the youngest, Scythes. Then she remembered the\\ninstructions she had received from Hercules, and, in obedience to\\nhis orders, she put her sons to the test. Two of them, Agathyrsus\\nand Gelonus, proving unequal to the task enjoined, their mother sent\\nthem out of the land; Scythes, the youngest, succeeded, and so he\\nwas allowed to remain. From Scythes, the son of Hercules, were descended\\nthe after kings of Scythia; and from the circumstance of the goblet\\nwhich hung from the belt, the Scythians to this day wear goblets at\\ntheir girdles. This was the only thing which the mother of Scythes\\ndid for him. Such is the tale told by the Greeks who dwell around\\nthe Pontus. \\n\\nThere is also another different story, now to be related, in which\\nI am more inclined to put faith than in any other. It is that the\\nwandering Scythians once dwelt in Asia, and there warred with the\\nMassagetae, but with ill success; they therefore quitted their homes,\\ncrossed the Araxes, and entered the land of Cimmeria. For the land\\nwhich is now inhabited by the Scyths was formerly the country of the\\nCimmerians. On their coming, the natives, who heard how numerous the\\ninvading army was, held a council. At this meeting opinion was divided,\\nand both parties stiffly maintained their own view; but the counsel\\nof the Royal tribe was the braver. For the others urged that the best\\nthing to be done was to leave the country, and avoid a contest with\\nso vast a host; but the Royal tribe advised remaining and fighting\\nfor the soil to the last. As neither party chose to give way, the\\none determined to retire without a blow and yield their lands to the\\ninvaders; but the other, remembering the good things which they had\\nenjoyed in their homes, and picturing to themselves the evils which\\nthey had to expect if they gave them up, resolved not to flee, but\\nrather to die and at least be buried in their fatherland. Having thus\\ndecided, they drew apart in two bodies, the one as numerous as the\\nother, and fought together. All of the Royal tribe were slain, and\\nthe people buried them near the river Tyras, where their grave is\\nstill to be seen. Then the rest of the Cimmerians departed, and the\\nScythians, on their coming, took possession of a deserted land.\\n\\nScythia still retains traces of the Cimmerians; there are Cimmerian\\ncastles, and a Cimmerian ferry, also a tract called Cimmeria, and\\na Cimmerian Bosphorus. It appears likewise that the Cimmerians, when\\nthey fled into Asia to escape the Scyths, made a settlement in the\\npeninsula where the Greek city of Sinope was afterwards built. The\\nScyths, it is plain, pursued them, and missing their road, poured\\ninto Media. For the Cimmerians kept the line which led along the sea-shore,\\nbut the Scyths in their pursuit held the Caucasus upon their right,\\nthus proceeding inland, and falling upon Media. This account is one\\nwhich is common both to Greeks and barbarians. \\n\\nAristeas also, son of Caystrobius, a native of Proconnesus, says in\\nthe course of his poem that wrapt in Bacchic fury he went as far as\\nthe Issedones. Above them dwelt the Arimaspi, men with one eye; still\\nfurther, the gold-guarding griffins; and beyond these, the Hyperboreans,\\nwho extended to the sea. Except the Hyperboreans, all these nations,\\nbeginning with the Arimaspi, were continually encroaching upon their\\nneighbours. Hence it came to pass that the Arimaspi drove the Issedonians\\nfrom their country, while the Issedonians dispossessed the Scyths;\\nand the Scyths, pressing upon the Cimmerians, who dwelt on the shores\\nof the Southern Sea, forced them to leave their land. Thus even Aristeas\\ndoes not agree in his account of this region with the Scythians.\\n\\nThe birthplace of Aristeas, the poet who sung of these things, I have\\nalready mentioned. I will now relate a tale which I heard concerning\\nhim both at Proconnesus and at Cyzicus. Aristeas, they said, who belonged\\nto one of the noblest families in the island, had entered one day\\ninto a fuller\\'s shop, when he suddenly dropt down dead. Hereupon the\\nfuller shut up his shop, and went to tell Aristeas\\' kindred what had\\nhappened. The report of the death had just spread through the town,\\nwhen a certain Cyzicenian, lately arrived from Artaca, contradicted\\nthe rumour, affirming that he had met Aristeas on his road to Cyzicus,\\nand had spoken with him. This man, therefore, strenuously denied the\\nrumour; the relations, however, proceeded to the fuller\\'s shop with\\nall things necessary for the funeral, intending to carry the body\\naway. But on the shop being opened, no Aristeas was found, either\\ndead or alive. Seven years afterwards he reappeared, they told me,\\nin Proconnesus, and wrote the poem called by the Greeks The Arimaspeia,\\nafter which he disappeared a second time. This is the tale current\\nin the two cities above-mentioned. \\n\\nWhat follows I know to have happened to the Metapontines of Italy,\\nthree hundred and forty years after the second disappearance of Aristeas,\\nas I collect by comparing the accounts given me at Proconnesus and\\nMetapontum. Aristeas then, as the Metapontines affirm, appeared to\\nthem in their own country, and ordered them to set up an altar in\\nhonour of Apollo, and to place near it a statue to be called that\\nof Aristeas the Proconnesian. \"Apollo,\" he told them, \"had come to\\ntheir country once, though he had visited no other Italiots; and he\\nhad been with Apollo at the time, not however in his present form,\\nbut in the shape of a crow.\" Having said so much, he vanished. Then\\nthe Metapontines, as they relate, sent to Delphi, and inquired of\\nthe god in what light they were to regard the appearance of this ghost\\nof a man. The Pythoness, in reply, bade them attend to what the spectre\\nsaid, \"for so it would go best with them.\" Thus advised, they did\\nas they had been directed: and there is now a statue bearing the name\\nof Aristeas, close by the image of Apollo in the market-place of Metapontum,\\nwith bay-trees standing around it. But enough has been said concerning\\nAristeas. \\n\\nWith regard to the regions which lie above the country whereof this\\nportion of my history treats, there is no one who possesses any exact\\nknowledge. Not a single person can I find who professes to be acquainted\\nwith them by actual observation. Even Aristeas, the traveller of whom\\nI lately spoke, does not claim- and he is writing poetry- to have\\nreached any farther than the Issedonians. What he relates concerning\\nthe regions beyond is, he confesses, mere hearsay, being the account\\nwhich the Issedonians gave him of those countries. However, I shall\\nproceed to mention all that I have learnt of these parts by the most\\nexact inquiries which I have been able to make concerning them.\\n\\nAbove the mart of the Borysthenites, which is situated in the very\\ncentre of the whole sea-coast of Scythia, the first people who inhabit\\nthe land are the Callipedae, a Greco-Scythic race. Next to them, as\\nyou go inland, dwell the people called the Alazonians. These two nations\\nin other respects resemble the Scythians in their usages, but sow\\nand eat corn, also onions, garlic, lentils, and millet. Beyond the\\nAlazonians reside Scythian cultivators, who grow corn, not for their\\nown use, but for sale. Still higher up are the Neuri. Northwards of\\nthe Neuri the continent, as far as it is known to us, is uninhabited.\\nThese are the nations along the course of the river Hypanis, west\\nof the Borysthenes. \\n\\nAcross the Borysthenes, the first country after you leave the coast\\nis Hylaea (the Woodland). Above this dwell the Scythian Husbandmen,\\nwhom the Greeks living near the Hypanis call Borysthenites, while\\nthey call themselves Olbiopolites. These Husbandmen extend eastward\\na distance of three days\\' journey to a river bearing the name of Panticapes,\\nwhile northward the country is theirs for eleven days\\' sail up the\\ncourse of the Borysthenes. Further inland there is a vast tract which\\nis uninhabited. Above this desolate region dwell the Cannibals, who\\nare a people apart, much unlike the Scythians. Above them the country\\nbecomes an utter desert; not a single tribe, so far as we know, inhabits\\nit. \\n\\nCrossing the Panticapes, and proceeding eastward of the Husbandmen,\\nwe come upon the wandering Scythians, who neither plough nor sow.\\nTheir country, and the whole of this region, except Hylaea, is quite\\nbare of trees. They extend towards the east a distance of fourteen\\'\\ndays\\' journey, occupying a tract which reaches to the river Gerrhus.\\n\\nOn the opposite side of the Gerrhus is the Royal district, as it is\\ncalled: here dwells the largest and bravest of the Scythian tribes,\\nwhich looks upon all the other tribes in the light of slaves. Its\\ncountry reaches on the south to Taurica, on the east to the trench\\ndug by the sons of the blind slaves, the mart upon the Palus Maeotis,\\ncalled Cremni (the Cliffs), and in part to the river Tanais. North\\nof the country of the Royal Scythians are the Melanchaeni (Black-Robes),\\na people of quite a different race from the Scythians. Beyond them\\nlie marshes and a region without inhabitants, so far as our knowledge\\nreaches. \\n\\nWhen one crosses the Tanais, one is no longer in Scythia; the first\\nregion on crossing is that of the Sauromatae, who, beginning at the\\nupper end of the Palus Maeotis, stretch northward a distance of fifteen\\ndays\\' journey, inhabiting a country which is entirely bare of trees,\\nwhether wild or cultivated. Above them, possessing the second region,\\ndwell the Budini, whose territory is thickly wooded with trees of\\nevery kind. \\n\\nBeyond the Budini, as one goes northward, first there is a desert,\\nseven days\\' journey across; after which, if one inclines somewhat\\nto the east, the Thyssagetae are reached, a numerous nation quite\\ndistinct from any other, and living by the chase. Adjoining them,\\nand within the limits of the same region, are the people who bear\\nthe name of Iyrcae; they also support themselves by hunting, which\\nthey practise in the following manner. The hunter climbs a tree, the\\nwhole country abounding in wood, and there sets himself in ambush;\\nhe has a dog at hand, and a horse, trained to lie down upon its belly,\\nand thus make itself low; the hunter keeps watch, and when he sees\\nhis game, lets fly an arrow; then mounting his horse, he gives the\\nbeast chase, his dog following hard all the while. Beyond these people,\\na little to the east, dwells a distinct tribe of Scyths, who revolted\\nonce from the Royal Scythians, and migrated into these parts.\\n\\nAs far as their country, the tract of land whereof I have been speaking\\nis all a smooth plain, and the soil deep; beyond you enter on a region\\nwhich is rugged and stony. Passing over a great extent of this rough\\ncountry, you come to a people dwelling at the foot of lofty mountains,\\nwho are said to be all- both men and women- bald from their birth,\\nto have flat noses, and very long chins. These people speak a language\\nof their own,. the dress which they wear is the same as the Scythian.\\nThey live on the fruit of a certain tree, the name of which is Ponticum;\\nin size it is about equal to our fig-tree, and it bears a fruit like\\na bean, with a stone inside. When the fruit is ripe, they strain it\\nthrough cloths; the juice which runs off is black and thick, and is\\ncalled by the natives \"aschy.\" They lap this up with their tongues,\\nand also mix it with milk for a drink; while they make the lees, which\\nare solid, into cakes, and eat them instead of meat; for they have\\nbut few sheep in their country, in which there is no good pasturage.\\nEach of them dwells under a tree, and they cover the tree in winter\\nwith a cloth of thick white felt, but take off the covering in the\\nsummer-time. No one harms these people, for they are looked upon as\\nsacred- they do not even possess any warlike weapons. When their neighbours\\nfall out, they make up the quarrel; and when one flies to them for\\nrefuge, he is safe from all hurt. They are called the Argippaeans.\\n\\nUp to this point the territory of which we are speaking is very completely\\nexplored, and all the nations between the coast and the bald-headed\\nmen are well known to us. For some of the Scythians are accustomed\\nto penetrate as far, of whom inquiry may easily be made, and Greeks\\nalso go there from the mart on the Borysthenes, and from the other\\nmarts along the Euxine. The Scythians who make this journey communicate\\nwith the inhabitants by means of seven interpreters and seven languages.\\n\\nThus far, therefore, the land is known; but beyond the bald-headed\\nmen lies a region of which no one can give any exact account. Lofty\\nand precipitous mountains, which are never crossed, bar further progress.\\nThe bald men say, but it does not seem to me credible, that the people\\nwho live in these mountains have feet like goats; and that after passing\\nthem you find another race of men, who sleep during one half of the\\nyear. This latter statement appears to me quite unworthy of credit.\\nThe region east of the bald-headed men is well known to be inhabited\\nby the Issedonians, but the tract that lies to the north of these\\ntwo nations is entirely unknown, except by the accounts which they\\ngive of it. \\n\\nThe Issedonians are said to have the following customs. When a man\\'s\\nfather dies, all the near relatives bring sheep to the house; which\\nare sacrificed, and their flesh cut in pieces, while at the same time\\nthe dead body undergoes the like treatment. The two sorts of flesh\\nare afterwards mixed together, and the whole is served up at a banquet.\\nThe head of the dead man is treated differently: it is stripped bare,\\ncleansed, and set in gold. It then becomes an ornament on which they\\npride themselves, and is brought out year by year at the great festival\\nwhich sons keep in honour of their fathers\\' death, just as the Greeks\\nkeep their Genesia. In other respects the Issedonians are reputed\\nto be observers of justice: and it is to be remarked that their women\\nhave equal authority with the men. Thus our knowledge extends as far\\nas this nation. \\n\\nThe regions beyond are known only from the accounts of the Issedonians,\\nby whom the stories are told of the one-eyed race of men and the gold-guarding\\ngriffins. These stories are received by the Scythians from the Issedonians,\\nand by them passed on to us Greeks: whence it arises that we give\\nthe one-eyed race the Scythian name of Arimaspi, \"arima\" being the\\nScythic word for \"one,\" and \"spu\" for \"the eye.\" \\n\\nThe whole district whereof we have here discoursed has winters of\\nexceeding rigour. During eight months the frost is so intense that\\nwater poured upon the ground does not form mud, but if a fire be lighted\\non it mud is produced. The sea freezes, and the Cimmerian Bosphorus\\nis frozen over. At that season the Scythians who dwell inside the\\ntrench make warlike expeditions upon the ice, and even drive their\\nwaggons across to the country of the Sindians. Such is the intensity\\nof the cold during eight months out of the twelve; and even in the\\nremaining four the climate is still cool. The character of the winter\\nlikewise is unlike that of the same season in any other country; for\\nat that time, when the rains ought to fall in Scythia, there is scarcely\\nany rain worth mentioning, while in summer it never gives over raining;\\nand thunder, which elsewhere is frequent then, in Scythia is unknown\\nin that part of the year, coming only in summer, when it is very heavy.\\nThunder in the winter-time is there accounted a prodigy; as also are\\nearthquakes, whether they happen in winter or summer. Horses bear\\nthe winter well, cold as it is, but mules and asses are quite unable\\nto bear it; whereas in other countries mules and asses are found to\\nendure the cold, while horses, if they stand still, are frost-bitten.\\n\\nTo me it seems that the cold may likewise be the cause which prevents\\nthe oxen in Scythia from having horns. There is a line of Homer\\'s\\nin the Odyssey which gives a support to my opinion:- \\n\\nLibya too, where horns hud quick on the foreheads of lambkins. He\\nmeans to say what is quite true, that in warm countries the horns\\ncome early. So too in countries where the cold is severe animals either\\nhave no horns, or grow them with difficulty- the cold being the cause\\nin this instance. \\n\\nHere I must express my wonder- additions being what my work always\\nfrom the very first affected- that in Elis, where the cold is not\\nremarkable, and there is nothing else to account for it, mules are\\nnever produced. The Eleans say it is in consequence of a curse; and\\ntheir habit is, when the breeding-time comes, to take their mares\\ninto one of the adjoining countries, and there keep them till they\\nare in foal, when they bring them back again into Elis. \\n\\nWith respect to the feathers which are said by the Scythians to fill\\nthe air, and to prevent persons from penetrating into the remoter\\nparts of the continent, even having any view of those regions, my\\nopinion is that in the countries above Scythia it always snows- less,\\nof course, in the summer than in the wintertime. Now snow when it\\nfalls looks like feathers, as every one is aware who has seen it come\\ndown close to him. These northern regions, therefore, are uninhabitable\\nby reason of the severity of the winter; and the Scythians, with their\\nneighbours, call the snow-flakes feathers because, I think, of the\\nlikeness which they bear to them. I have now related what is said\\nof the most distant parts of this continent whereof any account is\\ngiven. \\n\\nOf the Hyperboreans nothing is said either by the Scythians or by\\nany of the other dwellers in these regions, unless it be the Issedonians.\\nBut in my opinion, even the Issedonians are silent concerning them;\\notherwise the Scythians would have repeated their statements, as they\\ndo those concerning the one-eyed men. Hesiod, however, mentions them,\\nand Homer also in the Epigoni, if that be really a work of his.\\n\\nBut the persons who have by far the most to say on this subject are\\nthe Delians. They declare that certain offerings, packed in wheaten\\nstraw, were brought from the country of the Hyperboreans into Scythia,\\nand that the Scythians received them and passed them on to their neighbours\\nupon the west, who continued to pass them on until at last they reached\\nthe Adriatic. From hence they were sent southward, and when they came\\nto Greece, were received first of all by the Dodonaeans. Thence they\\ndescended to the Maliac Gulf, from which they were carried across\\ninto Euboea, where the people handed them on from city to city, till\\nthey came at length to Carystus. The Carystians took them over to\\nTenos, without stopping at Andros; and the Tenians brought them finally\\nto Delos. Such, according to their own account, was the road by which\\nthe offerings reached the Delians. Two damsels, they say, named Hyperoche\\nand Laodice, brought the first offerings from the Hyperboreans; and\\nwith them the Hyperboreans sent five men to keep them from all harm\\nby the way; these are the persons whom the Delians call \"Perpherees,\"\\nand to whom great honours are paid at Delos. Afterwards the Hyperboreans,\\nwhen they found that their messengers did not return, thinking it\\nwould be a grievous thing always to be liable to lose the envoys they\\nshould send, adopted the following plan:- they wrapped their offerings\\nin the wheaten straw, and bearing them to their borders, charged their\\nneighbours to send them forward from one nation to another, which\\nwas done accordingly, and in this way the offerings reached Delos.\\nI myself know of a practice like this, which obtains with the women\\nof Thrace and Paeonia. They in their sacrifices to the queenly Diana\\nbring wheaten straw always with their offerings. Of my own knowledge\\nI can testify that this is so. \\n\\nThe damsels sent by the Hyperboreans died in Delos; and in their honour\\nall the Delian girls and youths are wont to cut off their hair. The\\ngirls, before their marriage-day, cut off a curl, and twining it round\\na distaff, lay it upon the grave of the strangers. This grave is on\\nthe left as one enters the precinct of Diana, and has an olive-tree\\ngrowing on it. The youths wind some of their hair round a kind of\\ngrass, and, like the girls, place it upon the tomb. Such are the honours\\npaid to these damsels by the Delians. \\n\\nThey add that, once before, there came to Delos by the same road as\\nHyperoche and Laodice, two other virgins from the Hyperboreans, whose\\nnames were Arge and Opis. Hyperoche and Laodice came to bring to Ilithyia\\nthe offering which they had laid upon themselves, in acknowledgment\\nof their quick labours; but Arge and Opis came at the same time as\\nthe gods of Delos,\\' and are honoured by the Delians in a different\\nway. For the Delian women make collections in these maidens\\' names,\\nand invoke them in the hymn which Olen, a Lycian, composed for them;\\nand the rest of the islanders, and even the Ionians, have been taught\\nby the Delians to do the like. This Olen, who came from Lycia, made\\nthe other old hymns also which are sung in Delos. The Delians add\\nthat the ashes from the thigh-bones burnt upon the altar are scattered\\nover the tomb of Opis and Arge. Their tomb lies behind the temple\\nof Diana, facing the east, near the banqueting-hall of the Ceians.\\nThus much then, and no more, concerning the Hyperboreans.\\n\\nAs for the tale of Abaris, who is said to have been a Hyperborean,\\nand to have gone with his arrow all round the world without once eating,\\nI shall pass it by in silence. Thus much, however, is clear: if there\\nare Hyperboreans, there must also be Hypernotians. For my part, I\\ncannot but laugh when I see numbers of persons drawing maps of the\\nworld without having any reason to guide them; making, as they do,\\nthe ocean-stream to run all round the earth, and the earth itself\\nto be an exact circle, as if described by a pair of compasses, with\\nEurope and Asia just of the same size. The truth in this matter I\\nwill now proceed to explain in a very few words, making it clear what\\nthe real size of each region is, and what shape should be given them.\\n\\nThe Persians inhabit a country upon the southern or Erythraean sea;\\nabove them, to the north, are the Medes; beyond the Medes, the Saspirians;\\nbeyond them, the Colchians, reaching to the northern sea, into which\\nthe Phasis empties itself. These four nations fill the whole space\\nfrom one sea to the other. \\n\\nWest of these nations there project into the sea two tracts which\\nI will now describe; one, beginning at the river Phasis on the north,\\nstretches along the Euxine and the Hellespont to Sigeum in the Troas;\\nwhile on the south it reaches from the Myriandrian gulf, which adjoins\\nPhoenicia, to the Triopic promontory. This is one of the tracts, and\\nis inhabited by thirty different nations. \\n\\nThe other starts from the country of the Persians, and stretches into\\nthe Erythraean sea, containing first Persia, then Assyria, and after\\nAssyria, Arabia. It ends, that is to say, it is considered to end,\\nthough it does not really come to a termination, at the Arabian gulf-\\nthe gulf whereinto Darius conducted the canal which he made from the\\nNile. Between Persia and Phoenicia lies a broad and ample tract of\\ncountry, after which the region I am describing skirts our sea, stretching\\nfrom Phoenicia along the coast of Palestine-Syria till it comes to\\nEgypt, where it terminates. This entire tract contains but three nations.\\nThe whole of Asia west of the country of the Persians is comprised\\nin these two regions. \\n\\nBeyond the tract occupied by the Persians, Medes, Saspirians, and\\nColchians, towards the east and the region of the sunrise, Asia is\\nbounded on the south by the Erythraean sea, and on the north by the\\nCaspian and the river Araxes, which flows towards the rising sun.\\nTill you reach India the country is peopled; but further east it is\\nvoid of inhabitants, and no one can say what sort of region it is.\\nSuch then is the shape, and such the size of Asia. \\n\\nLibya belongs to one of the above-mentioned tracts, for it adjoins\\non Egypt. In Egypt the tract is at first a narrow neck, the distance\\nfrom our sea to the Erythraean not exceeding a hundred thousand fathoms,\\nin other words, a thousand furlongs; but from the point where the\\nneck ends, the tract which bears the name of Libya is of very great\\nbreadth. \\n\\nFor my part I am astonished that men should ever have divided Libya,\\nAsia, and Europe as they have, for they are exceedingly unequal. Europe\\nextends the entire length of the other two, and for breadth will not\\neven (as I think) bear to be compared to them. As for Libya, we know\\nit to be washed on all sides by the sea, except where it is attached\\nto Asia. This discovery was first made by Necos, the Egyptian king,\\nwho on desisting from the canal which he had begun between the Nile\\nand the Arabian gulf, sent to sea a number of ships manned by Phoenicians,\\nwith orders to make for the Pillars of Hercules, and return to Egypt\\nthrough them, and by the Mediterranean. The Phoenicians took their\\ndeparture from Egypt by way of the Erythraean sea, and so sailed into\\nthe southern ocean. When autumn came, they went ashore, wherever they\\nmight happen to be, and having sown a tract of land with corn, waited\\nuntil the grain was fit to cut. Having reaped it, they again set sail;\\nand thus it came to pass that two whole years went by, and it was\\nnot till the third year that they doubled the Pillars of Hercules,\\nand made good their voyage home. On their return, they declared- I\\nfor my part do not believe them, but perhaps others may- that in sailing\\nround Libya they had the sun upon their right hand. In this way was\\nthe extent of Libya first discovered. \\n\\nNext to these Phoenicians the Carthaginians, according to their own\\naccounts, made the voyage. For Sataspes, son of Teaspes the Achaemenian,\\ndid not circumnavigate Libya, though he was sent to do so; but, fearing\\nthe length and desolateness of the journey, he turned back and left\\nunaccomplished the task which had been set him by his mother. This\\nman had used violence towards a maiden, the daughter of Zopyrus, son\\nof Megabyzus, and King Xerxes was about to impale him for the offence,\\nwhen his mother, who was a sister of Darius, begged him off, undertaking\\nto punish his crime more heavily than the king himself had designed.\\nShe would force him, she said, to sail round Libya and return to Egypt\\nby the Arabian gulf. Xerxes gave his consent; and Sataspes went down\\nto Egypt, and there got a ship and crew, with which he set sail for\\nthe Pillars of Hercules. Having passed the Straits, he doubled the\\nLibyan headland, known as Cape Soloeis, and proceeded southward. Following\\nthis course for many months over a vast stretch of sea, and finding\\nthat more water than he had crossed still lay ever before him, he\\nput about, and came back to Egypt. Thence proceeding to the court,\\nhe made report to Xerxes, that at the farthest point to which he had\\nreached, the coast was occupied by a dwarfish race, who wore a dress\\nmade from the palm tree. These people, whenever he landed, left their\\ntowns and fled away to the mountains; his men, however, did them no\\nwrong, only entering into their cities and taking some of their cattle.\\nThe reason why he had not sailed quite round Libya was, he said, because\\nthe ship stopped, and would no go any further. Xerxes, however, did\\nnot accept this account for true; and so Sataspes, as he had failed\\nto accomplish the task set him, was impaled by the king\\'s orders in\\naccordance with the former sentence. One of his eunuchs, on hearing\\nof his death, ran away with a great portion of his wealth, and reached\\nSamos, where a certain Samian seized the whole. I know the man\\'s name\\nwell, but I shall willingly forget it here. \\n\\nOf the greater part of Asia Darius was the discoverer. Wishing to\\nknow where the Indus (which is the only river save one that produces\\ncrocodiles) emptied itself into the sea, he sent a number of men,\\non whose truthfulness he could rely, and among them Scylax of Caryanda,\\nto sail down the river. They started from the city of Caspatyrus,\\nin the region called Pactyica, and sailed down the stream in an easterly\\ndirection to the sea. Here they turned westward, and, after a voyage\\nof thirty months, reached the place from which the Egyptian king,\\nof whom I spoke above, sent the Phoenicians to sail round Libya. After\\nthis voyage was completed, Darius conquered the Indians, and made\\nuse of the sea in those parts. Thus all Asia, except the eastern portion,\\nhas been found to be similarly circumstanced with Libya.\\n\\nBut the boundaries of Europe are quite unknown, and there is not a\\nman who can say whether any sea girds it round either on the north\\nor on the east, while in length it undoubtedly extends as far as both\\nthe other two. For my part I cannot conceive why three names, and\\nwomen\\'s names especially, should ever have been given to a tract which\\nis in reality one, nor why the Egyptian Nile and the Colchian Phasis\\n(or according to others the Maeotic Tanais and Cimmerian ferry) should\\nhave been fixed upon for the boundary lines; nor can I even say who\\ngave the three tracts their names, or whence they took the epithets.\\nAccording to the Greeks in general, Libya was so called after a certain\\nLibya, a native woman, and Asia after the wife of Prometheus. The\\nLydians, however, put in a claim to the latter name, which, they declare,\\nwas not derived from Asia the wife of Prometheus, but from Asies,\\nthe son of Cotys, and grandson of Manes, who also gave name to the\\ntribe Asias at Sardis. As for Europe, no one can say whether it is\\nsurrounded by the sea or not, neither is it known whence the name\\nof Europe was derived, nor who gave it name, unless we say that Europe\\nwas so called after the Tyrian Europe, and before her time was nameless,\\nlike the other divisions. But it is certain that Europe was an Asiatic,\\nand never even set foot on the land which the Greeks now call Europe,\\nonly sailing from Phoenicia to Crete, and from Crete to Lycia. However\\nlet us quit these matters. We shall ourselves continue to use the\\nnames which custom sanctions. \\n\\nThe Euxine sea, where Darius now went to war, has nations dwelling\\naround it, with the one exception of the Scythians, more unpolished\\nthan those of any other region that we know of. For, setting aside\\nAnacharsis and the Scythian people, there is not within this region\\na single nation which can be put forward as having any claims to wisdom,\\nor which has produced a single person of any high repute. The Scythians\\nindeed have in one respect, and that the very most important of all\\nthose that fall under man\\'s control, shown themselves wiser than any\\nnation upon the face of the earth. Their customs otherwise are not\\nsuch as I admire. The one thing of which I speak is the contrivance\\nwhereby they make it impossible for the enemy who invades them to\\nescape destruction, while they themselves are entirely out of his\\nreach, unless it please them to engage with him. Having neither cities\\nnor forts, and carrying their dwellings with them wherever they go;\\naccustomed, moreover, one and all of them, to shoot from horseback;\\nand living not by husbandry but on their cattle, their waggons the\\nonly houses that they possess, how can they fail of being unconquerable,\\nand unassailable even? \\n\\nThe nature of their country, and the rivers by which it is intersected,\\ngreatly favour this mode of resisting attacks. For the land is level,\\nwell watered, and abounding in pasture; while the rivers which traverse\\nit are almost equal in number to the canals of Egypt. Of these I shall\\nonly mention the most famous and such as are navigable to some distance\\nfrom the sea. They are, the Ister, which has five mouths; the Tyras,\\nthe Hypanis, the Borysthenes, the Panticapes, the Hypacyris, the Gerrhus,\\nand the Tanais. The courses of these streams I shall now proceed to\\ndescribe. \\n\\nThe Ister is of all the rivers with which we are acquainted the mightiest.\\nIt never varies in height, but continues at the same level summer\\nand winter. Counting from the west it is the first of the Scythian\\nrivers, and the reason of its being the greatest is that it receives\\nthe water of several tributaries. Now the tributaries which swell\\nits flood are the following: first, on the side of Scythia, these\\nfive- the stream called by the Scythians Porata, and by the Greeks\\nPyretus, the Tiarantus, the Ararus, the Naparis, and the Ordessus.\\nThe first mentioned is a great stream, and is the easternmost of the\\ntributaries. The Tiarantus is of less volume, and more to the west.\\nThe Ararus, Naparis, and Ordessus fall into the Ister between these\\ntwo. All the above mentioned are genuine Scythian rivers, and go to\\nswell the current of the Ister. \\n\\nFrom the country of the Agathyrsi comes down another river, the Maris,\\nwhich empties itself into the same; and from the heights of Haemus\\ndescend with a northern course three mighty streams, the Atlas, the\\nAuras, and the Tibisis, and pour their waters into it. Thrace gives\\nit three tributaries, the Athrys, the Noes, and the Artanes, which\\nall pass through the country of the Crobyzian Thracians. Another tributary\\nis furnished by Paeonia, namely, the Scius; this river, rising near\\nMount Rhodope, forces its way through the chain of Haemus, and so\\nreaches the Ister. From Illyria comes another stream, the Angrus,\\nwhich has a course from south to north, and after watering the Triballian\\nplain, falls into the Brongus, which falls into the Ister. So the\\nIster is augmented by these two streams, both considerable. Besides\\nall these, the Ister receives also the waters of the Carpis and the\\nAlpis, two rivers running in a northerly direction from the country\\nabove the Umbrians. For the Ister flows through the whole extent of\\nEurope, rising in the country of the Celts (the most westerly of all\\nthe nations of Europe, excepting the Cynetians), and thence running\\nacross the continent till it reaches Scythia, whereof it washes the\\nflanks. \\n\\nAll these streams, then, and many others, add their waters to swell\\nthe flood of the Ister, which thus increased becomes the mightiest\\nof rivers; for undoubtedly if we compare the stream of the Nile with\\nthe single stream of the Ister, we must give the preference to the\\nNile, of which no tributary river, nor even rivulet, augments the\\nvolume. The Ister remains at the same level both summer and winter-\\nowing to the following reasons, as I believe. During the winter it\\nruns at its natural height, or a very little higher, because in those\\ncountries there is scarcely any rain in winter, but constant snow.\\nWhen summer comes, this snow, which is of great depth, begins to melt,\\nand flows into the Ister, which is swelled at that season, not only\\nby this cause but also by the rains, which are heavy and frequent\\nat that part of the year. Thus the various streams which go to form\\nthe Ister are higher in summer than in winter, and just so much higher\\nas the sun\\'s power and attraction are greater; so that these two causes\\ncounteract each other, and the effect is to produce a balance, whereby\\nthe Ister remains always at the same level. \\n\\nThis, then, is one of the great Scythian rivers; the next to it is\\nthe Tyras, which rises from a great lake separating Scythia from the\\nland of the Neuri, and runs with a southerly course to the sea. Greeks\\ndwell at the mouth of the river, who are called Tyritae.\\n\\nThe third river is the Hypanis. This stream rises within the limits\\nof Scythia, and has its source in another vast lake, around which\\nwild white horses graze. The lake is called, properly enough, the\\nMother of the Hypanis. The Hypanis, rising here, during the distance\\nof five days\\' navigation is a shallow stream, and the water sweet\\nand pure; thence, however, to the sea, which is a distance of four\\ndays, it is exceedingly bitter. This change is caused by its receiving\\ninto it at that point a brook the waters of which are so bitter that,\\nalthough it is but a tiny rivulet, it nevertheless taints the entire\\nHypanis, which is a large stream among those of the second order.\\nThe source of this bitter spring is on the borders of the Scythian\\nHusbandmen, where they adjoin upon the Alazonians; and the place where\\nit rises is called in the Scythic tongue Exampaeus, which means in\\nour language, \"The Sacred Ways.\" The spring itself bears the same\\nname. The Tyras and the Hypanis approach each other in the country\\nof the Alazonians, but afterwards separate, and leave a wide space\\nbetween their streams. \\n\\nThe fourth of the Scythian rivers is the Borysthenes. Next to the\\nIster, it is the greatest of them all; and, in my judgment, it is\\nthe most productive river, not merely in Scythia, but in the whole\\nworld, excepting only the Nile, with which no stream can possibly\\ncompare. It has upon its banks the loveliest and most excellent pasturages\\nfor cattle; it contains abundance of the most delicious fish; its\\nwater is most pleasant to the taste; its stream is limpid, while all\\nthe other rivers near it are muddy; the richest harvests spring up\\nalong its course, and where the ground is not sown, the heaviest crops\\nof grass; while salt forms in great plenty about its mouth without\\nhuman aid, and large fish are taken in it of the sort called Antacaei,\\nwithout any prickly bones, and good for pickling. Nor are these the\\nwhole of its marvels. As far inland as the place named Gerrhus, which\\nis distant forty days\\' voyage from the sea, its course is known, and\\nits direction is from north to south; but above this no one has traced\\nit, so as to say through what countries it flows. It enters the territory\\nof the Scythian Husbandmen after running for some time across a desert\\nregion, and continues for ten days\\' navigation to pass through the\\nland which they inhabit. It is the only river besides the Nile the\\nsources of which are unknown to me, as they are also (I believe) to\\nall the other Greeks. Not long before it reaches the sea, the Borysthenes\\nis joined by the Hypanis, which pours its waters into the same lake.\\nThe land that lies between them, a narrow point like the beak of a\\nship, is called Cape Hippolaus. Here is a temple dedicated to Ceres,\\nand opposite the temple upon the Hypanis is the dwelling-place of\\nthe Borysthenites. But enough has been said of these streams.\\n\\nNext in succession comes the fifth river, called the Panticapes, which\\nhas, like the Borysthenes, a course from north to south, and rises\\nfrom a lake. The space between this river and the Borysthenes is occupied\\nby the Scythians who are engaged in husbandry. After watering their\\ncountry, the Panticapes flows through Hylaea, and empties itself into\\nthe Borysthenes. \\n\\nThe sixth stream is the Hypacyris, a river rising from a lake, and\\nrunning directly through the middle of the Nomadic Scythians. It falls\\ninto the sea near the city of Carcinitis, leaving Hylaea and the course\\nof Achilles to the right. \\n\\nThe seventh river is the Gerrhus, which is a branch thrown out by\\nthe Borysthenes at the point where the course of that stream first\\nbegins to be known, to wit, the region called by the same name as\\nthe stream itself, viz. Gerrhus. This river on its passage towards\\nthe sea divides the country of the Nomadic from that of the Royal\\nScyths. It runs into the Hypacyris. \\n\\nThe eighth river is the Tanais, a stream which has its source, far\\nup the country, in a lake of vast size, and which empties itself into\\nanother still larger lake, the Palus Maeotis, whereby the country\\nof the Royal Scythians is divided from that of the Sauromatae. The\\nTanais receives the waters of a tributary stream, called the Hyrgis.\\n\\nSuch then are the rivers of chief note in Scythia. The grass which\\nthe land produces is more apt to generate gall in the beasts that\\nfeed on it than any other grass which is known to us, as plainly appears\\non the opening of their carcases. \\n\\nThus abundantly are the Scythians provided with the most important\\nnecessaries. Their manners and customs come now to be described. They\\nworship only the following gods, namely, Vesta, whom they reverence\\nbeyond all the rest, Jupiter, and Tellus, whom they consider to be\\nthe wife of Jupiter; and after these Apollo, Celestial Venus, Hercules,\\nand Mars. These gods are worshipped by the whole nation: the Royal\\nScythians offer sacrifice likewise to Neptune. In the Scythic tongue\\nVesta is called Tabiti, Jupiter (very properly, in my judgment) Papaeus,\\nTellus Apia, Apollo Oetosyrus, Celestial Venus Artimpasa, and Neptune\\nThamimasadas. They use no images, altars, or temples, except in the\\nworship of Mars; but in his worship they do use them. \\n\\nThe manner of their sacrifices is everywhere and in every case the\\nsame; the victim stands with its two fore-feet bound together by a\\ncord, and the person who is about to offer, taking his station behind\\nthe victim, gives the rope a pull, and thereby throws the animal down;\\nas it falls he invokes the god to whom he is offering; after which\\nhe puts a noose round the animal\\'s neck, and, inserting a small stick,\\ntwists it round, and so strangles him. No fire is lighted, there is\\nno consecration, and no pouring out of drink-offerings; but directly\\nthat the beast is strangled the sacrificer flays him, and then sets\\nto work to boil the flesh. \\n\\nAs Scythia, however, is utterly barren of firewood, a plan has had\\nto be contrived for boiling the flesh, which is the following. After\\nflaying the beasts, they take out all the bones, and (if they possess\\nsuch gear) put the flesh into boilers made in the country, which are\\nvery like the cauldrons of the Lesbians, except that they are of a\\nmuch larger size; then placing the bones of the animals beneath the\\ncauldron, they set them alight, and so boil the meat. If they do not\\nhappen to possess a cauldron, they make the animal\\'s paunch hold the\\nflesh, and pouring in at the same time a little water, lay the bones\\nunder and light them. The bones burn beautifully; and the paunch easily\\ncontains all the flesh when it is stript from the bones, so that by\\nthis plan your ox is made to boil himself, and other victims also\\nto do the like. When the meat is all cooked, the sacrificer offers\\na portion of the flesh and of the entrails, by casting it on the ground\\nbefore him. They sacrifice all sorts of cattle, but most commonly\\nhorses. \\n\\nSuch are the victims offered to the other gods, and such is the mode\\nin which they are sacrificed; but the rites paid to Mars are different.\\nIn every district, at the seat of government, there stands a temple\\nof this god, whereof the following is a description. It is a pile\\nof brushwood, made of a vast quantity of fagots, in length and breadth\\nthree furlongs; in height somewhat less, having a square platform\\nupon the top, three sides of which are precipitous, while the fourth\\nslopes so that men may walk up it. Each year a hundred and fifty waggon-loads\\nof brushwood are added to the pile, which sinks continually by reason\\nof the rains. An antique iron sword is planted on the top of every\\nsuch mound, and serves as the image of Mars: yearly sacrifices of\\ncattle and of horses are made to it, and more victims are offered\\nthus than to all the rest of their gods. When prisoners are taken\\nin war, out of every hundred men they sacrifice one, not however with\\nthe same rites as the cattle, but with different. Libations of wine\\nare first poured upon their heads, after which they are slaughtered\\nover a vessel; the vessel is then carried up to the top of the pile,\\nand the blood poured upon the scymitar. While this takes place at\\nthe top of the mound, below, by the side of the temple, the right\\nhands and arms of the slaughtered prisoners are cut off, and tossed\\non high into the air. Then the other victims are slain, and those\\nwho have offered the sacrifice depart, leaving the hands and arms\\nwhere they may chance to have fallen, and the bodies also, separate.\\n\\nSuch are the observances of the Scythians with respect to sacrifice.\\nThey never use swine for the purpose, nor indeed is it their wont\\nto breed them in any part of their country. \\n\\nIn what concerns war, their customs are the following. The Scythian\\nsoldier drinks the blood of the first man he overthrows in battle.\\nWhatever number he slays, he cuts off all their heads, and carries\\nthem to the king; since he is thus entitled to a share of the booty,\\nwhereto he forfeits all claim if he does not produce a head. In order\\nto strip the skull of its covering, he makes a cut round the head\\nabove the ears, and, laying hold of the scalp, shakes the skull out;\\nthen with the rib of an ox he scrapes the scalp clean of flesh, and\\nsoftening it by rubbing between the hands, uses it thenceforth as\\na napkin. The Scyth is proud of these scalps, and hangs them from\\nhis bridle-rein; the greater the number of such napkins that a man\\ncan show, the more highly is he esteemed among them. Many make themselves\\ncloaks, like the capotes of our peasants, by sewing a quantity of\\nthese scalps together. Others flay the right arms of their dead enemies,\\nand make of the skin, which stripped off with the nails hanging to\\nit, a covering for their quivers. Now the skin of a man is thick and\\nglossy, and would in whiteness surpass almost all other hides. Some\\neven flay the entire body of their enemy, and stretching it upon a\\nframe carry it about with them wherever they ride. Such are the Scythian\\ncustoms with respect to scalps and skins. \\n\\nThe skulls of their enemies, not indeed of all, but of those whom\\nthey most detest, they treat as follows. Having sawn off the portion\\nbelow the eyebrows, and cleaned out the inside, they cover the outside\\nwith leather. When a man is poor, this is all that he does; but if\\nhe is rich, he also lines the inside with gold: in either case the\\nskull is used as a drinking-cup. They do the same with the skulls\\nof their own kith and kin if they have been at feud with them, and\\nhave vanquished them in the presence of the king. When strangers whom\\nthey deem of any account come to visit them, these skulls are handed\\nround, and the host tells how that these were his relations who made\\nwar upon him, and how that he got the better of them; all this being\\nlooked upon as proof of bravery. \\n\\nOnce a year the governor of each district, at a set place in his own\\nprovince, mingles a bowl of wine, of which all Scythians have a right\\nto drink by whom foes have been slain; while they who have slain no\\nenemy are not allowed to taste of the bowl, but sit aloof in disgrace.\\nNo greater shame than this can happen to them. Such as have slain\\na very large number of foes, have two cups instead of one, and drink\\nfrom both. \\n\\nScythia has an abundance of soothsayers, who foretell the future by\\nmeans of a number of willow wands. A large bundle of these wands is\\nbrought and laid on the ground. The soothsayer unties the bundle,\\nand places each wand by itself, at the same time uttering his prophecy:\\nthen, while he is still speaking, he gathers the rods together again,\\nand makes them up once more into a bundle. This mode of divination\\nis of home growth in Scythia. The Enarees, or woman-like men, have\\nanother method, which they say Venus taught them. It is done with\\nthe inner bark of the linden-tree. They take a piece of this bark,\\nand, splitting it into three strips, keep twining the strips about\\ntheir fingers, and untwining them, while they prophesy. \\n\\nWhenever the Scythian king falls sick, he sends for the three soothsayers\\nof most renown at the time, who come and make trial of their art in\\nthe mode above described. Generally they say that the king is ill\\nbecause such or such a person, mentioning his name, has sworn falsely\\nby the royal hearth. This is the usual oath among the Scythians, when\\nthey wish to swear with very great solemnity. Then the man accused\\nof having foresworn himself is arrested and brought before the king.\\nThe soothsayers tell him that by their art it is clear he has sworn\\na false oath by the royal hearth, and so caused the illness of the\\nking- he denies the charge, protests that he has sworn no false oath,\\nand loudly complains of the wrong done to him. Upon this the king\\nsends for six new soothsayers, who try the matter by soothsaying.\\nIf they too find the man guilty of the offence, straightway he is\\nbeheaded by those who first accused him, and his goods are parted\\namong them: if, on the contrary, they acquit him, other soothsayers,\\nand again others, are sent for, to try the case. Should the greater\\nnumber decide in favour of the man\\'s innocence, then they who first\\naccused him forfeit their lives. \\n\\nThe mode of their execution is the following: a waggon is loaded with\\nbrushwood, and oxen are harnessed to it; the soothsayers, with their\\nfeet tied together, their hands bound behind their backs, and their\\nmouths gagged, are thrust into the midst of the brushwood; finally\\nthe wood is set alight, and the oxen, being startled, are made to\\nrush off with the waggon. It often happens that the oxen and the soothsayers\\nare both consumed together, but sometimes the pole of the waggon is\\nburnt through, and the oxen escape with a scorching. Diviners- lying\\ndiviners, they call them- are burnt in the way described, for other\\ncauses besides the one here spoken of. When the king puts one of them\\nto death, he takes care not to let any of his sons survive: all the\\nmale offspring are slain with the father, only the females being allowed\\nto live. \\n\\nOaths among the Scyths are accompanied with the following ceremonies:\\na large earthern bowl is filled with wine, and the parties to the\\noath, wounding themselves slightly with a knife or an awl, drop some\\nof their blood into the wine; then they plunge into the mixture a\\nscymitar, some arrows, a battle-axe, and a javelin, all the while\\nrepeating prayers; lastly the two contracting parties drink each a\\ndraught from the bowl, as do also the chief men among their followers.\\n\\nThe tombs of their kings are in the land of the Gerrhi, who dwell\\nat the point where the Borysthenes is first navigable. Here, when\\nthe king dies, they dig a grave, which is square in shape, and of\\ngreat size. When it is ready, they take the king\\'s corpse, and, having\\nopened the belly, and cleaned out the inside, fill the cavity with\\na preparation of chopped cypress, frankincense, parsley-seed, and\\nanise-seed, after which they sew up the opening, enclose the body\\nin wax, and, placing it on a waggon, carry it about through all the\\ndifferent tribes. On this procession each tribe, when it receives\\nthe corpse, imitates the example which is first set by the Royal Scythians;\\nevery man chops off a piece of his ear, crops his hair close, and\\nmakes a cut all round his arm, lacerates his forehead and his nose,\\nand thrusts an arrow through his left hand. Then they who have the\\ncare of the corpse carry it with them to another of the tribes which\\nare under the Scythian rule, followed by those whom they first visited.\\nOn completing the circuit of all the tribes under their sway, they\\nfind themselves in the country of the Gerrhi, who are the most remote\\nof all, and so they come to the tombs of the kings. There the body\\nof the dead king is laid in the grave prepared for it, stretched upon\\na mattress; spears are fixed in the ground on either side of the corpse,\\nand beams stretched across above it to form a roof, which is covered\\nwith a thatching of osier twigs. In the open space around the body\\nof the king they bury one of his concubines, first killing her by\\nstrangling, and also his cup-bearer, his cook, his groom, his lacquey,\\nhis messenger, some of his horses, firstlings of all his other possessions,\\nand some golden cups; for they use neither silver nor brass. After\\nthis they set to work, and raise a vast mound above the grave, all\\nof them vying with each other and seeking to make it as tall as possible.\\n\\nWhen a year is gone by, further ceremonies take place. Fifty of the\\nbest of the late king\\'s attendants are taken, all native Scythians-\\nfor, as bought slaves are unknown in the country, the Scythian kings\\nchoose any of their subjects that they like, to wait on them- fifty\\nof these are taken and strangled, with fifty of the most beautiful\\nhorses. When they are dead, their bowels are taken out, and the cavity\\ncleaned, filled full of chaff, and straightway sewn up again. This\\ndone, a number of posts are driven into the ground, in sets of two\\npairs each, and on every pair half the felly of a wheel is placed\\narchwise; then strong stakes are run lengthways through the bodies\\nof the horses from tail to neck, and they are mounted up upon the\\nfellies, so that the felly in front supports the shoulders of the\\nhorse, while that behind sustains the belly and quarters, the legs\\ndangling in mid-air; each horse is furnished with a bit and bridle,\\nwhich latter is stretched out in front of the horse, and fastened\\nto a peg. The fifty strangled youths are then mounted severally on\\nthe fifty horses. To effect this, a second stake is passed through\\ntheir bodies along the course of the spine to the neck; the lower\\nend of which projects from the body, and is fixed into a socket, made\\nin the stake that runs lengthwise down the horse. The fifty riders\\nare thus ranged in a circle round the tomb, and so left.\\n\\nSuch, then, is the mode in which the kings are buried: as for the\\npeople, when any one dies, his nearest of kin lay him upon a waggon\\nand take him round to all his friends in succession: each receives\\nthem in turn and entertains them with a banquet, whereat the dead\\nman is served with a portion of all that is set before the others;\\nthis is done for forty days, at the end of which time the burial takes\\nplace. After the burial, those engaged in it have to purify themselves,\\nwhich they do in the following way. First they well soap and wash\\ntheir heads; then, in order to cleanse their bodies, they act as follows:\\nthey make a booth by fixing in the ground three sticks inclined towards\\none another, and stretching around them woollen felts, which they\\narrange so as to fit as close as possible: inside the booth a dish\\nis placed upon the ground, into which they put a number of red-hot\\nstones, and then add some hemp-seed. \\n\\nHemp grows in Scythia: it is very like flax; only that it is a much\\ncoarser and taller plant: some grows wild about the country, some\\nis produced by cultivation: the Thracians make garments of it which\\nclosely resemble linen; so much so, indeed, that if a person has never\\nseen hemp he is sure to think they are linen, and if he has, unless\\nhe is very experienced in such matters, he will not know of which\\nmaterial they are. \\n\\nThe Scythians, as I said, take some of this hemp-seed, and, creeping\\nunder the felt coverings, throw it upon the red-hot stones; immediately\\nit smokes, and gives out such a vapour as no Grecian vapour-bath can\\nexceed; the Scyths, delighted, shout for joy, and this vapour serves\\nthem instead of a water-bath; for they never by any chance wash their\\nbodies with water. Their women make a mixture of cypress, cedar, and\\nfrankincense wood, which they pound into a paste upon a rough piece\\nof stone, adding a little water to it. With this substance, which\\nis of a thick consistency, they plaster their faces all over, and\\nindeed their whole bodies. A sweet odour is thereby imparted to them,\\nand when they take off the plaster on the day following, their skin\\nis clean and glossy. \\n\\nThe Scythians have an extreme hatred of all foreign customs, particularly\\nof those in use among the Greeks, as the instances of Anacharsis,\\nand, more lately, of Scylas, have fully shown. The former, after he\\nhad travelled over a great portion of the world, and displayed wherever\\nhe went many proofs of wisdom, as he sailed through the Hellespont\\non his return to Scythia touched at Cyzicus. There he found the inhabitants\\ncelebrating with much pomp and magnificence a festival to the Mother\\nof the Gods, and was himself induced to make a vow to the goddess,\\nwhereby he engaged, if he got back safe and sound to his home, that\\nhe would give her a festival and a night-procession in all respects\\nlike those which he had seen in Cyzicus. When, therefore, he arrived\\nin Scythia, he betook himself to the district called the Woodland,\\nwhich lies opposite the course of Achilles, and is covered with trees\\nof all manner of different kinds, and there went through all the sacred\\nrites with the tabour in his hand, and the images tied to him. While\\nthus employed, he was noticed by one of the Scythians, who went and\\ntold king Saulius what he had seen. Then king Saulius came in person,\\nand when he perceived what Anacharsis was about, he shot at him with\\nan arrow and killed him. To this day, if you ask the Scyths about\\nAnacharsis, they pretend ignorance of him, because of his Grecian\\ntravels and adoption of the customs of foreigners. I learnt, however,\\nfrom Timnes, the steward of Ariapithes, that Anacharsis was paternal\\nuncle to the Scythian king Idanthyrsus, being the son of Gnurus, who\\nwas the son of Lycus and the grandson of Spargapithes. If Anacharsis\\nwere really of this house, it must have been by his own brother that\\nhe was slain, for Idanthyrsus was a son of the Saulius who put Anacharsis\\nto death. \\n\\nI have heard, however, another tale, very different from this, which\\nis told by the Peloponnesians: they say, that Anacharsis was sent\\nby the king of the Scyths to make acquaintance with Greece- that he\\nwent, and on his return home reported that the Greeks were all occupied\\nin the pursuit of every kind of knowledge, except the Lacedaemonians;\\nwho, however, alone knew how to converse sensibly. A silly tale this,\\nwhich the Greeks have invented for their amusement! There is no doubt\\nthat Anacharsis suffered death in the mode already related, on account\\nof his attachment to foreign customs, and the intercourse which he\\nheld with the Greeks. \\n\\nScylas, likewise, the son of Ariapithes, many years later, met with\\nalmost the very same fate. Ariapithes, the Scythian king, had several\\nsons, among them this Scylas, who was the child, not of a native Scyth,\\nbut of a woman of Istria. Bred up by her, Scylas gained an acquaintance\\nwith the Greek language and letters. Some time afterwards, Ariapithes\\nwas treacherously slain by Spargapithes, king of the Agathyrsi; whereupon\\nScylas succeeded to the throne, and married one of his father\\'s wives,\\na woman named Opoea. This Opoea was a Scythian by birth, and had brought\\nAriapithes a son called Oricus. Now when Scylas found himself king\\nof Scythia, as he disliked the Scythic mode of life, and was attached,\\nby his bringing up, to the manners of the Greeks, he made it his usual\\npractice, whenever he came with his army to the town of the Borysthenites,\\nwho, according to their own account, are colonists of the Milesians-\\nhe made it his practice, I say, to leave the army before the city,\\nand, having entered within the walls by himself, and carefully closed\\nthe gates, to exchange his Scythian dress for Grecian garments, and\\nin this attire to walk about the forum, without guards or retinue.\\nThe Borysthenites kept watch at the gates, that no Scythian might\\nsee the king thus apparelled. Scylas, meanwhile, lived exactly as\\nthe Greeks, and even offered sacrifices to the gods according to the\\nGrecian rites. In this way he would pass a month, or more, with the\\nBorysthenites, after which he would clothe himself again in his Scythian\\ndress, and so take his departure. This he did repeatedly, and even\\nbuilt himself a house in Borysthenes, and married a wife there who\\nwas a native of the place. \\n\\nBut when the time came that was ordained to bring him woe, the occasion\\nof his ruin was the following. He wanted to be initiated in the Bacchic\\nmysteries, and was on the point of obtaining admission to the rites,\\nwhen a most strange prodigy occurred to him. The house which he possessed,\\nas I mentioned a short time back, in the city of the Borysthenites,\\na building of great extent and erected at a vast cost, round which\\nthere stood a number of sphinxes and griffins carved in white marble,\\nwas struck by lightning from on high, and burnt to the ground. Scylas,\\nnevertheless, went on and received the initiation. Now the Scythians\\nare wont to reproach the Greeks with their Bacchanal rage, and to\\nsay that it is not reasonable to imagine there is a god who impels\\nmen to madness. No sooner, therefore, was Scylas initiated in the\\nBacchic mysteries than one of the Borysthenites went and carried the\\nnews to the Scythians \"You Scyths laugh at us\" he said, \"because we\\nrave when the god seizes us. But now our god has seized upon your\\nking, who raves like us, and is maddened by the influence. If you\\nthink I do not tell you true, come with me, and I will show him to\\nyou.\" The chiefs of the Scythians went with the man accordingly, and\\nthe Borysthenite, conducting them into the city, placed them secretly\\non one of the towers. Presently Scylas passed by with the band of\\nrevellers, raving like the rest, and was seen by the watchers. Regarding\\nthe matter as a very great misfortune they instantly departed, and\\ncame and told the army what they had witnessed. \\n\\nWhen, therefore, Scylas, after leaving Borysthenes, was about returning\\nhome, the Scythians broke out into revolt. They put at their head\\nOctamasadas, grandson (on the mother\\'s side) of Teres. Then Scylas,\\nwhen he learned the danger with which he was threatened, and the reason\\nof the disturbance, made his escape to Thrace. Octamasadas, discovering\\nwhither he had fled, marched after him, and had reached the Ister,\\nwhen he was met by the forces of the Thracians. The two armies were\\nabout to engage, but before they joined battle, Sitalces sent a message\\nto Octamasadas to this effect- \"Why should there be trial of arms\\nbetwixt thee and me? Thou art my own sister\\'s son, and thou hast in\\nthy keeping my brother. Surrender him into my hands, and I will give\\nthy Scylas back to thee. So neither thou nor I will risk our armies.\"\\nSitalces sent this message to Octamasadas, by a herald, and Octamasadas,\\nwith whom a brother of Sitalces had formerly taken refuge, accepted\\nthe terms. He surrendered his own uncle to Sitalces, and obtained\\nin exchange his brother Scylas. Sitalces took his brother with him\\nand withdrew; but Octamasadas beheaded Scylas upon the spot. Thus\\nrigidly do the Scythians maintain their own customs, and thus severely\\ndo they punish such as adopt foreign usages. \\n\\nWhat the population of Scythia is I was not able to learn with certainty;\\nthe accounts which I received varied from one another. I heard from\\nsome that they were very numerous indeed; others made their numbers\\nbut scanty for such a nation as the Scyths. Thus much, however, I\\nwitnessed with my own eyes. There is a tract called Exampaeus between\\nthe Borysthenes and the Hypanis. I made some mention of it in a former\\nplace, where I spoke of the bitter stream which rising there flows\\ninto the Hypanis, and renders the water of that river undrinkable.\\nHere then stands a brazen bowl, six times as big as that at the entrance\\nof the Euxine, which Pausanias, the son of Cleombrotus, set up. Such\\nas have never seen that vessel may understand me better if I say that\\nthe Scythian bowl holds with ease six hundred amphorae, and is of\\nthe thickness of six fingers\\' breadth. The natives gave me the following\\naccount of the manner in which it was made. One of their kings, by\\nname Ariantas, wishing to know the number of his subjects, ordered\\nthem all to bring him, on pain of death, the point off one of their\\narrows. They obeyed; and he collected thereby a vast heap of arrow-heads,\\nwhich he resolved to form into a memorial that might go down to posterity.\\nAccordingly he made of them this bowl, and dedicated it at Exampaeus.\\nThis was all that I could learn concerning the number of the Scythians.\\n\\nThe country has no marvels except its rivers, which are larger and\\nmore numerous than those of any other land. These, and the vastness\\nof the great plain, are worthy of note, and one thing besides, which\\nI am about to mention. They show a footmark of Hercules, impressed\\non a rock, in shape like the print of a man\\'s foot, but two cubits\\nin length. It is in the neighbourhood of the Tyras. Having described\\nthis, I return to the subject on which I originally proposed to discourse.\\n\\nThe preparations of Darius against the Scythians had begun, messengers\\nhad been despatched on all sides with the king\\'s commands, some being\\nrequired to furnish troops, others to supply ships, others again to\\nbridge the Thracian Bosphorus, when Artabanus, son of Hystaspes and\\nbrother of Darius, entreated the king to desist from his expedition,\\nurging on him the great difficulty of attacking Scythia. Good, however,\\nas the advice of Artabanus was, it failed to persuade Darius. He therefore\\nceased his reasonings; and Darius, when his preparations were complete,\\nled his army forth from Susa. \\n\\nIt was then that a certain Persian, by name Oeobazus, the father of\\nthree sons, all of whom were to accompany the army, came and prayed\\nthe king that he would allow one of his sons to remain with him. Darius\\nmade answer, as if he regarded him in the light of a friend who had\\nurged a moderate request, \"that he would allow them all to remain.\"\\nOeobazus was overjoyed, expecting that all his children would be excused\\nfrom serving; the king, however, bade his attendants take the three\\nsons of Oeobazus and forthwith put them to death. Thus they were all\\nleft behind, but not till they had been deprived of life.\\n\\nWhen Darius, on his march from Susa, reached the territory of Chalcedon\\non the shores of the Bosphorus, where the bridge had been made, he\\ntook ship and sailed thence to the Cyanean islands, which, according\\nto the Greeks, once floated. He took his seat also in the temple and\\nsurveyed the Pontus, which is indeed well worthy of consideration.\\nThere is not in the world any other sea so wonderful: it extends in\\nlength eleven thousand one hundred furlongs, and its breadth, at the\\nwidest part, is three thousand three hundred. The mouth is but four\\nfurlongs wide; and this strait, called the Bosphorus, and across which\\nthe bridge of Darius had been thrown, is a hundred and twenty furlongs\\nin length, reaching from the Euxine to the Propontis. The Propontis\\nis five hundred furlongs across, and fourteen hundred long. Its waters\\nflow into the Hellespont, the length of which is four hundred furlongs,\\nand the width no more than seven. The Hellespont opens into the wide\\nsea called the Egean. \\n\\nThe mode in which these distances have been measured is the following.\\nIn a long day a vessel generally accomplishes about seventy thousand\\nfathoms, in the night sixty thousand. Now from the mouth of the Pontus\\nto the river Phasis, which is the extreme length of this sea, is a\\nvoyage of nine days and eight nights, which makes the distance one\\nmillion one hundred and ten thousand fathoms, or eleven thousand one\\nhundred furlongs. Again, from Sindica, to Themiscyra on the river\\nThermodon, where the Pontus is wider than at any other place, is a\\nsail of three days and two nights; which makes three hundred and thirty\\nthousand fathoms, or three thousand three hundred furlongs. Such is\\nthe plan on which I have measured the Pontus, the Bosphorus, and the\\nHellespont, and such is the account which I have to give of them.\\nThe Pontus has also a lake belonging to it, not very much inferior\\nto itself in size. The waters of this lake run into the Pontus: it\\nis called the Maeotis, and also the Mother of the Pontus.\\n\\nDarius, after he had finished his survey, sailed back to the bridge,\\nwhich had been constructed for him by Mandrocles a Samian. He likewise\\nsurveyed the Bosphorus, and erected upon its shores two pillars of\\nwhite marble, whereupon he inscribed the names of all the nations\\nwhich formed his army- on the one pillar in Greek, on the other in\\nAssyrian characters. Now his army was drawn from all the nations under\\nhis sway; and the whole amount, without reckoning the naval forces,\\nwas seven hundred thousand men, including cavalry. The fleet consisted\\nof six hundred ships. Some time afterwards the Byzantines removed\\nthese pillars to their own city, and used them for an altar which\\nthey erected to Orthosian Diana. One block remained behind: it lay\\nnear the temple of Bacchus at Byzantium, and was covered with Assyrian\\nwriting. The spot where Darius bridged the Bosphorus was, I think,\\nbut I speak only from conjecture, half-way between the city of Byzantium\\nand the temple at the mouth of the strait. \\n\\nDarius was so pleased with the bridge thrown across the strait by\\nthe Samain Mandrocles, that he not only bestowed upon him all the\\ncustomary presents, but gave him ten of every kind. Mandrocles, by\\nthe way of offering first-fruits from these presents, caused a picture\\nto be painted which showed the whole of the bridge, with King Darius\\nsitting in a seat of honour, and his army engaged in the passage.\\nThis painting he dedicated in the temple of Juno at Samos, attaching\\nto it the inscription following:- \\n\\nThe fish-fraught Bosphorus bridged, to Juno\\'s fane \\nDid Mandrocles this proud memorial bring; \\nWhen for himself a crown he\\'d skill to gain, \\nFor Samos praise, contenting the Great King. Such was the memorial\\nof his work which was left by the architect of the bridge.\\n\\nDarius, after rewarding Mandrocles, passed into Europe, while he ordered\\nthe Ionians to enter the Pontus, and sail to the mouth of the Ister.\\nThere he bade them throw a bridge across the stream and await his\\ncoming. The Ionians, Aeolians, and Hellespontians were the nations\\nwhich furnished the chief strength of his navy. So the fleet, threading\\nthe Cyanean Isles, proceeded straight to the Ister, and, mounting\\nthe river to the point where its channels separate, a distance of\\ntwo days\\' voyage from the sea, yoked the neck of the stream. Meantime\\nDarius, who had crossed the Bosphorus by the bridge over it, marched\\nthrough Thrace; and happening upon the sources of the Tearus, pitched\\nhis camp and made a stay of three days. \\n\\nNow the Tearus is said by those who dwell near it, to be the most\\nhealthful of all streams, and to cure, among other diseases, the scab\\neither in man or beast. Its sources, which are eight and thirty in\\nnumber, all flowing from the same rock, are in part cold, in part\\nhot. They lie at an equal distance from the town of Heraeum near Perinthus,\\nand Apollonia on the Euxine, a two days\\' journey from each. This river,\\nthe Tearus, is a tributary of the Contadesdus, which runs into the\\nAgrianes, and that into the Hebrus. The Hebrus empties itself into\\nthe sea near the city of Aenus. \\n\\nHere then, on the banks of the Tearus, Darius stopped and pitched\\nhis camp. The river charmed him so, that he caused a pillar to be\\nerected in this place also, with an inscription to the following effect:\\n\"The fountains of the Tearus afford the best and most beautiful water\\nof all rivers: they were visited, on his march into Scythia, by the\\nbest and most beautiful of men, Darius, son of Hystaspes, king of\\nthe Persians, and of the whole continent.\" Such was the inscription\\nwhich he set up at this place. \\n\\nMarching thence, he came to a second river, called the Artiscus, which\\nflows through the country of the Odrysians. Here he fixed upon a certain\\nspot, where every one of his soldiers should throw a stone as he passed\\nby. When his orders were obeyed, Darius continued his march, leaving\\nbehind him great hills formed of the stones cast by his troops.\\n\\nBefore arriving at the Ister, the first people whom he subdued were\\nthe Getae, who believe in their immortality. The Thracians of Salmydessus,\\nand those who dwelt above the cities of Apollonia and Mesembria- the\\nScyrmiadae and Nipsaeans, as they are called- gave themselves up to\\nDarius without a struggle; but the Getae obstinately defending themselves,\\nwere forthwith enslaved, notwithstanding that they are the noblest\\nas well as the most just of all the Thracian tribes. \\n\\nThe belief of the Getae in respect of immortality is the following.\\nThey think that they do not really die, but that when they depart\\nthis life they go to Zalmoxis, who is called also Gebeleizis by some\\namong them. To this god every five years they send a messenger, who\\nis chosen by lot out of the whole nation, and charged to bear him\\ntheir several requests. Their mode of sending him is this. A number\\nof them stand in order, each holding in his hand three darts; others\\ntake the man who is to be sent to Zalmoxis, and swinging him by his\\nhands and feet, toss him into the air so that he falls upon the points\\nof the weapons. If he is pierced and dies, they think that the god\\nis propitious to them; but if not, they lay the fault on the messenger,\\nwho (they say) is a wicked man: and so they choose another to send\\naway. The messages are given while the man is still alive. This same\\npeople, when it lightens and thunders, aim their arrows at the sky,\\nuttering threats against the god; and they do not believe that there\\nis any god but their own. \\n\\nI am told by the Greeks who dwell on the shores of the Hellespont\\nand the Pontus, that this Zalmoxis was in reality a man, that he lived\\nat Samos, and while there was the slave of Pythagoras son of Mnesarchus.\\nAfter obtaining his freedom he grew rich, and leaving Samos, returned\\nto his own country. The Thracians at that time lived in a wretched\\nway, and were a poor ignorant race; Zalmoxis, therefore, who by his\\ncommerce with the Greeks, and especially with one who was by no means\\ntheir most contemptible philosopher, Pythagoras to wit, was acquainted\\nwith the Ionic mode of life and with manners more refined than those\\ncurrent among his countrymen, had a chamber built, in which from time\\nto time he received and feasted all the principal Thracians, using\\nthe occasion to teach them that neither he, nor they, his boon companions,\\nnor any of their posterity would ever perish, but that they would\\nall go to a place where they would live for aye in the enjoyment of\\nevery conceivable good. While he was acting in this way, and holding\\nthis kind of discourse, he was constructing an apartment underground,\\ninto which, when it was completed, he withdrew, vanishing suddenly\\nfrom the eyes of the Thracians, who greatly regretted his loss, and\\nmourned over him as one dead. He meanwhile abode in his secret chamber\\nthree full years, after which he came forth from his concealment,\\nand showed himself once more to his countrymen, who were thus brought\\nto believe in the truth of what he had taught them. Such is the account\\nof the Greeks. \\n\\nI for my part neither put entire faith in this story of Zalmoxis and\\nhis underground chamber, nor do I altogether discredit it: but I believe\\nZalmoxis to have lived long before the time of Pythagoras. Whether\\nthere was ever really a man of the name, or whether Zalmoxis is nothing\\nbut a native god of the Getae, I now bid him farewell. As for the\\nGetae themselves, the people who observe the practices described above,\\nthey were now reduced by the Persians, and accompanied the army of\\nDarius. \\n\\nWhen Darius, with his land forces, reached the Ister, he made his\\ntroops cross the stream, and after all were gone over gave orders\\nto the Ionians to break the bridge, and follow him with the whole\\nnaval force in his land march. They were about to obey his command,\\nwhen the general of the Mytilenaeans, Coes son of Erxander, having\\nfirst asked whether it was agreeable to the king to listen to one\\nwho wished to speak his mind, addressed him in the words following:-\\n\"Thou art about, Sire, to attack a country no part of which is cultivated,\\nand wherein there is not a single inhabited city. Keep this bridge,\\nthen, as it is, and leave those who built it to watch over it. So\\nif we come up with the Scythians and succeed against them as we could\\nwish, we may return by this route; or if we fail of finding them,\\nour retreat will still be secure. For I have no fear lest the Scythians\\ndefeat us in battle, but my dread is lest we be unable to discover\\nthem, and suffer loss while we wander about their territory. And now,\\nmayhap, it will be said, I advise thee thus in the hope of being myself\\nallowed to remain behind; but in truth I have no other design than\\nto recommend the course which seems to me the best; nor will I consent\\nto be among those left behind, but my resolve is, in any case, to\\nfollow thee.\" The advice of Coes pleased Darius highly, who thus replied\\nto him:- \"Dear Lesbian, when I am safe home again in my palace, be\\nsure thou come to me, and with good deeds will I recompense thy good\\nwords of to-day.\" \\n\\nHaving so said, the king took a leathern thong, and tying sixty knots\\nin it, called together the Ionian tyrants, and spoke thus to them:-\\n\"Men of Ionia, my former commands to you concerning the bridge are\\nnow withdrawn. See, here is a thong: take it, and observe my bidding\\nwith respect to it. From the time that I leave you to march forward\\ninto Scythia, untie every day one of the knots. If I do not return\\nbefore the last day to which the knots will hold out, then leave your\\nstation, and sail to your several homes. Meanwhile, understand that\\nmy resolve is changed, and that you are to guard the bridge with all\\ncare, and watch over its safety and preservation. By so doing ye will\\noblige me greatly.\" When Darius had thus spoken, he set out on his\\nmarch with all speed. \\n\\nBefore you come to Scythia, on the sea coast, lies Thrace. The land\\nhere makes a sweep, and then Scythia begins, the Ister falling into\\nthe sea at this point with its mouth facing the east. Starting from\\nthe Ister I shall now describe the measurements of the seashore of\\nScythia. Immediately that the Ister is crossed, Old Scythia begins,\\nand continues as far as the city called Carcinitis, fronting towards\\nthe south wind and the mid-day. Here upon the same sea, there lies\\na mountainous tract projecting into the Pontus, which is inhabited\\nby the Tauri, as far as what is called the Rugged Chersonese, which\\nruns out into the sea upon the east. For the boundaries of Scythia\\nextend on two sides to two different seas, one upon the south, and\\nthe other towards the east, as is also the case with Attica. And the\\nTauri occupy a position in Scythia like that which a people would\\nhold in Attica, who, being foreigners and not Athenians, should inhabit\\nthe high land of Sunium, from Thoricus to the township of Anaphlystus,\\nif this tract projected into the sea somewhat further than it does.\\nSuch, to compare great things with small, is the Tauric territory.\\nFor the sake of those who may not have made the voyage round these\\nparts of Attica, I will illustrate in another way. It is as if in\\nIapygia a line were drawn from Port Brundusium to Tarentum, and a\\npeople different from the Iapygians inhabited the promontory. These\\ntwo instances may suggest a number of others where the shape of the\\nland closely resembles that of Taurica. \\n\\nBeyond this tract, we find the Scythians again in possession of the\\ncountry above the Tauri and the parts bordering on the eastern sea,\\nas also of the whole district lying west of the Cimmerian Bosphorus\\nand the Palus Maeotis, as far as the river Tanais, which empties itself\\ninto that lake at its upper end. As for the inland boundaries of Scythia,\\nif we start from the Ister, we find it enclosed by the following tribes,\\nfirst the Agathyrsi, next the Neuri, then the Androphagi, and last\\nof all, the Melanchaeni. \\n\\nScythia then, which is square in shape, and has two of its sides reaching\\ndown to the sea, extends inland to the same distance that it stretches\\nalong the coast, and is equal every way. For it is a ten days\\' journey\\nfrom the Ister to the Borysthenes, and ten more from the Borysthenes\\nto the Palus Maeotis, while the distance from the coast inland to\\nthe country of the Melanchaeni, who dwell above Scythia, is a journey\\nof twenty days. I reckon the day\\'s journey at two hundred furlongs.\\nThus the two sides which run straight inland are four thousand furlongs\\neach, and the transverse sides at right angles to these are also of\\nthe same length, which gives the full size of Scythia. \\n\\nThe Scythians, reflecting on their situation, perceived that they\\nwere not strong enough by themselves to contend with the army of Darius\\nin open fight. They, therefore, sent envoys to the neighbouring nations,\\nwhose kings had already met, and were in consultation upon the advance\\nof so vast a host. Now they who had come together were the kings of\\nthe Tauri, the Agathyrsi, the Neuri, the Androphagi, the Melanchaeni,\\nthe Geloni, the Budini, and the Sauromatae. \\n\\nThe Tauri have the following customs. They offer in sacrifice to the\\nVirgin all shipwrecked persons, and all Greeks compelled to put into\\ntheir ports by stress of weather. The mode of sacrifice is this. After\\nthe preparatory ceremonies, they strike the victim on the head with\\na club. Then, according to some accounts, they hurl the trunk from\\nthe precipice whereon the temple stands, and nail the head to a cross.\\nOthers grant that the head is treated in this way, but deny that the\\nbody is thrown down the cliff- on the contrary, they say, it is buried.\\nThe goddess to whom these sacrifices are offered the Tauri themselves\\ndeclare to be Iphigenia the daughter of Agamemnon. When they take\\nprisoners in war they treat them in the following way. The man who\\nhas taken a captive cuts off his head, and carrying it to his home,\\nfixes it upon a tall pole, which he elevates above his house, most\\ncommonly over the chimney. The reason that the heads are set up so\\nhigh, is (it is said) in order that the whole house may be under their\\nprotection. These people live entirely by war and plundering.\\n\\nThe Agathyrsi are a race of men very luxurious, and very fond of wearing\\ngold on their persons. They have wives in common, that so they may\\nbe all brothers, and, as members of one family, may neither envy nor\\nhate one another. In other respects their customs approach nearly\\nto those of the Thracians. \\n\\nThe Neurian customs are like the Scythian. One generation before the\\nattack of Darius they were driven from their land by a huge multitude\\nof serpents which invaded them. Of these some were produced in their\\nown country, while others, and those by far the greater number, came\\nin from the deserts on the north. Suffering grievously beneath this\\nscourge, they quitted their homes, and took refuge with the Budini.\\nIt seems that these people are conjurers: for both the Scythians and\\nthe Greeks who dwell in Scythia say that every Neurian once a year\\nbecomes a wolf for a few days, at the end of which time he is restored\\nto his proper shape. Not that I believe this, but they constantly\\naffirm it to be true, and are even ready to back their assertion with\\nan oath. \\n\\nThe manners of the Androphagi are more savage than those of any other\\nrace. They neither observe justice, nor are governed, by any laws.\\nThey are nomads, and their dress is Scythian; but the language which\\nthey speak is peculiar to themselves. Unlike any other nation in these\\nparts, they are cannibals. \\n\\nThe Melanchaeni wear, all of them, black cloaks, and from this derive\\nthe name which they bear. Their customs are Scythic. \\n\\nThe Budini are a large and powerful nation: they have all deep blue\\neyes, and bright red hair. There is a city in their territory, called\\nGelonus, which is surrounded with a lofty wall, thirty furlongs each\\nway, built entirely of wood. All the houses in the place and all the\\ntemples are of the same material. Here are temples built in honour\\nof the Grecian gods, and adorned after the Greek fashion with images,\\naltars, and shrines, all in wood. There is even a festival, held every\\nthird year in honour of Bacchus, at which the natives fall into the\\nBacchic fury. For the fact is that the Geloni were anciently Greeks,\\nwho, being driven out of the factories along the coast, fled to the\\nBudini and took up their abode with them. They still speak a language\\nhalf Greek, half Scythian. \\n\\nThe Budini, however, do not speak the same language as the Geloni,\\nnor is their mode of life the same. They are the aboriginal people\\nof the country, and are nomads; unlike any of the neighbouring races,\\nthey eat lice. The Geloni on the contrary, are tillers of the soil,\\neat bread, have gardens, and both in shape and complexion are quite\\ndifferent from the Budini. The Greeks notwithstanding call these latter\\nGeloni; but it is a mistake to give them the name. Their country is\\nthickly planted with trees of all manner of kinds. In the very woodiest\\npart is a broad deep lake, surrounded by marshy ground with reeds\\ngrowing on it. Here otters are caught, and beavers, with another sort\\nof animal which has a square face. With the skins of this last the\\nnatives border their capotes: and they also get from them a remedy,\\nwhich is of virtue in diseases of the womb. \\n\\nIt is reported of the Sauromatae, that when the Greeks fought with\\nthe Amazons, whom the Scythians call Oior-pata or \"man-slayers,\" as\\nit may be rendered, Oior being Scythic for \"man,\" and pata for \"to\\nslay\"- It is reported, I say, that the Greeks after gaining the battle\\nof the Thermodon, put to sea, taking with them on board three of their\\nvessels all the Amazons whom they had made prisoners; and that these\\nwomen upon the voyage rose up against the crews, and massacred them\\nto a man. As however they were quite strange to ships, and did not\\nknow how to use either rudder, sails, or oars, they were carried,\\nafter the death of the men, where the winds and the waves listed.\\nAt last they reached the shores of the Palus Maeotis and came to a\\nplace called Cremni or \"the Cliffs,\" which is in the country of the\\nfree Scythians. Here they went ashore, and proceeded by land towards\\nthe inhabited regions; the first herd of horses which they fell in\\nwith they seized, and mounting upon their backs, fell to plundering\\nthe Scythian territory. \\n\\nThe Scyths could not tell what to make of the attack upon them- the\\ndress, the language, the nation itself, were alike unknown whence\\nthe enemy had come even, was a marvel. Imagining, however, that they\\nwere all men of about the same age, they went out against them, and\\nfought a battle. Some of the bodies of the slain fell into their hands,\\nwhereby they discovered the truth. Hereupon they deliberated, and\\nmade a resolve to kill no more of them, but to send against them a\\ndetachment of their youngest men, as near as they could guess equal\\nto the women in number, with orders to encamp in their neighbourhood,\\nand do as they saw them do- when the Amazons advanced against them,\\nthey were to retire, and avoid a fight- when they halted, the young\\nmen were to approach and pitch their camp near the camp of the enemy.\\nAll this they did on account of their strong desire to obtain children\\nfrom so notable a race. \\n\\nSo the youths departed, and obeyed the orders which had been given\\nthem. The Amazons soon found out that they had not come to do them\\nany harm; and so they on their part ceased to offer the Scythians\\nany molestation. And now day after day the camps approached nearer\\nto one another; both parties led the same life, neither having anything\\nbut their arms and horses, so that they were forced to support themselves\\nby hunting and pillage. \\n\\nAt last an incident brought two of them together- the man easily gained\\nthe good graces of the woman, who bade him by signs (for they did\\nnot understand each other\\'s language) to bring a friend the next day\\nto the spot where they had met- promising on her part to bring with\\nher another woman. He did so, and the woman kept her word. When the\\nrest of the youths heard what had taken place, they also sought and\\ngained the favour of the other Amazons. \\n\\nThe two camps were then joined in one, the Scythians living with the\\nAmazons as their wives; and the men were unable to learn the tongue\\nof the women, but the women soon caught up the tongue of the men.\\nWhen they could thus understand one another, the Scyths addressed\\nthe Amazons in these words- \"We have parents, and properties, let\\nus therefore give up this mode of life, and return to our nation,\\nand live with them. You shall be our wives there no less than here,\\nand we promise you to have no others.\" But the Amazons said- \"We could\\nnot live with your women- our customs are quite different from theirs.\\nTo draw the bow, to hurl the javelin, to bestride the horse, these\\nare our arts of womanly employments we know nothing. Your women, on\\nthe contrary, do none of these things; but stay at home in their waggons,\\nengaged in womanish tasks, and never go out to hunt, or to do anything.\\nWe should never agree together. But if you truly wish to keep us as\\nyour wives, and would conduct yourselves with strict justice towards\\nus, go you home to your parents, bid them give you your inheritance,\\nand then come back to us, and let us and you live together by ourselves.\"\\n\\nThe youths approved of the advice, and followed it. They went and\\ngot the portion of goods which fell to them, returned with it, and\\nrejoined their wives, who then addressed them in these words following:-\\n\"We are ashamed, and afraid to live in the country where we now are.\\nNot only have we stolen you from your fathers, but we have done great\\ndamage to Scythia by our ravages. As you like us for wives, grant\\nthe request we make of you. Let us leave this country together, and\\ngo and dwell beyond the Tanais.\" Again the youths complied.\\n\\nCrossing the Tanais they journeyed eastward a distance of three days\\'\\nmarch from that stream, and again northward a distance of three days\\'\\nmarch from the Palus Maeotis. Here they came to the country where\\nthey now live, and took up their abode in it. The women of the Sauromatae\\nhave continued from that day to the present to observe their ancient\\ncustoms, frequently hunting on horseback with their husbands, sometimes\\neven unaccompanied; in war taking the field; and wearing the very\\nsame dress as the men. \\n\\nThe Sauromatae speak the language of Scythia, but have never talked\\nit correctly, because the Amazons learnt it imperfectly at the first.\\nTheir marriage-law lays it down that no girl shall wed till she has\\nkilled a man in battle. Sometimes it happens that a woman dies unmarried\\nat an advanced age, having never been able in her whole lifetime to\\nfulfil the condition. \\n\\nThe envoys of the Scythians, on being introduced into the presence\\nof the kings of these nations, who were assembled to deliberate, made\\nit known to them that the Persian, after subduing the whole of the\\nother continent, had thrown a bridge over the strait of the Bosphorus,\\nand crossed into the continent of Europe, where he had reduced the\\nThracians, and was now making a bridge over the Ister, his aim being\\nto bring under his sway all Europe also. \"Stand ye not aloof then\\nfrom this contest,\" they went on to say, \"look not on tamely while\\nwe are perishing- but make common cause with us, and together let\\nus meet the enemy. If ye refuse, we must yield to the pressure, and\\neither quit our country, or make terms with the invaders. For what\\nelse is left for us to do, if your aid be withheld from us? The blow,\\nbe sure, will not light on you more gently upon this account. The\\nPersian comes against you no less than against us: and will not be\\ncontent, after we are conquered, to leave you in peace. We can bring\\nstrong proof of what we here advance. Had the Persian leader indeed\\ncome to avenge the wrongs which he suffered at our hands when we enslaved\\nhis people, and to war on us only, he would have been bound to march\\nstraight upon Scythia, without molesting any nation by the way. Then\\nit would have been plain to all that Scythia alone was aimed at. But\\nnow, what has his conduct been? From the moment of his entrance into\\nEurope, he has subjugated without exception every nation that lay\\nin his path. All the tribes of the Thracians have been brought under\\nhis sway, and among them even our next neighbours, the Getae.\"\\n\\nThe assembled princes of the nations, after hearing all that the Scythians\\nhad to say, deliberated. At the end opinion was divided- the kings\\nof the Geloni, Budini, and Sauromatae were of accord, and pledged\\nthemselves to give assistance to the Scythians; but the Agathyrsian\\nand Neurian princes, together with the sovereigns of the Androphagi,\\nthe Melanchaeni, and the Tauri, replied to their request as follows:-\\n\"If you had not been the first to wrong the Persians, and begin the\\nwar, we should have thought the request you make just;- we should\\nthen have complied with your wishes, and joined our arms with yours.\\nNow, however, the case stands thus- you, independently of us, invaded\\nthe land of the Persians, and so long as God gave you the power, lorded\\nit over them: raised up now by the same God, they are come to do to\\nyou the like. We, on our part, did no wrong to these men in the former\\nwar, and will not be the first to commit wrong now. If they invade\\nour land, and begin aggressions upon us, we will not suffer them;\\nbut, till we see this come to pass, we will remain at home. For we\\nbelieve that the Persians are not come to attack us, but to punish\\nthose who are guilty of first injuring them.\" \\n\\nWhen this reply reached the Scythians, they resolved, as the neighbouring\\nnations refused their alliance, that they would not openly venture\\non any pitched battle with the enemy, but would retire before them,\\ndriving off their herds, choking up all the wells and springs as they\\nretreated, and leaving the whole country bare of forage. They divided\\nthemselves into three bands, one of which, namely, that commanded\\nby Scopasis, it was agreed should be joined by the Sauromatae, and\\nif the Persians advanced in the direction of the Tanais, should retreat\\nalong the shores of the Palus Maeotis and make for that river; while\\nif the Persians retired, they should at once pursue and harass them.\\nThe two other divisions, the principal one under the command of Idanthyrsus,\\nand the third, of which Taxacis was king, were to unite in one, and,\\njoined by the detachments of the Geloni and Budini, were, like the\\nothers, to keep at the distance of a day\\'s march from the Persians,\\nfalling back as they advanced, and doing the same as the others. And\\nfirst, they were to take the direction of the nations which had refused\\nto join the alliance, and were to draw the war upon them: that so,\\nif they would not of their own free will engage in the contest, they\\nmight by these means be forced into it. Afterwards, it was agreed\\nthat they should retire into their own land, and, should it on deliberation\\nappear to them expedient, join battle with the enemy. \\n\\nWhen these measures had been determined on, the Scythians went out\\nto meet the army of Darius, sending on in front as scouts the fleetest\\nof their horsemen. Their waggons wherein their women and their children\\nlived, and all their cattle, except such a number as was wanted for\\nfood, which they kept with them, were made to precede them in their\\nretreat, and departed, with orders to keep marching, without change\\nof course, to the north. \\n\\nThe scouts of the Scythians found the Persian host advanced three\\ndays\\' march from the Ister, and immediately took the lead of them\\nat the distance of a day\\'s march, encamping from time to time, and\\ndestroying all that grow on the ground. The Persians no sooner caught\\nsight of the Scythian horse than they pursued upon their track, while\\nthe enemy retired before them. The pursuit of the Persians was directed\\ntowards the single division of the Scythian army, and thus their line\\nof march was eastward toward the Tanais. The Scyths crossed the river\\nand the Persians after them, still in pursuit. in this way they passed\\nthrough the country of the Sauromatae, and entered that of the Budini.\\n\\nAs long as the march of the Persian army lay through the countries\\nof the Scythians and Sauromatae, there was nothing which they could\\ndamage, the land being waste and barren; but on entering the territories\\nof the Budini, they came upon the wooden fortress above mentioned,\\nwhich was deserted by its inhabitants and left quite empty of everything.\\nThis place they burnt to the ground; and having so done, again pressed\\nforward on the track of the retreating Scythians, till, having passed\\nthrough the entire country of the Budini, they reached the desert,\\nwhich has no inhabitants, and extends a distance of seven days\\' journey\\nabove the Budinian territory. Beyond this desert dwell the Thyssagetae,\\nout of whose land four great streams flow. These rivers all traverse\\nthe country of the Maeotians, and fall into the Palus Maeotis. Their\\nnames are the Lycus, the Oarus, the Tanais, and the Syrgis.\\n\\nWhen Darius reached the desert, he paused from his pursuit, and halted\\nhis army upon the Oarus. Here he built eight large forts, at an equal\\ndistance from one another, sixty furlongs apart or thereabouts, the\\nruins of which were still remaining in my day. During the time that\\nhe was so occupied, the Scythians whom he had been following made\\na circuit by the higher regions, and re-entered Scythia. On their\\ncomplete disappearance, Darius, seeing nothing more of them, left\\nhis forts half finished, and returned towards the west. He imagined\\nthat the Scythians whom he had seen were the entire nation, and that\\nthey had fled in that direction. \\n\\nHe now quickened his march, and entering Scythia, fell in with the\\ntwo combined divisions of the Scythian army, and instantly gave them\\nchase. They kept to their plan of retreating before him at the distance\\nof a day\\'s march; and, he still following them hotly, they led him,\\nas had been previously settled, into the territories of the nations\\nthat had refused to become their allies, and first of all into the\\ncountry of the Melanchaeni. Great disturbance was caused among this\\npeople by the invasion of the Scyths first, and then of the Persians.\\nSo, having harassed them after this sort, the Scythians led the way\\ninto the land of the Androphagi, with the same result as before; and\\nthence passed onwards into Neuris, where their coming likewise spread\\ndismay among the inhabitants. Still retreating they approached the\\nAgathyrsi; but this people, which had witnessed the flight and terror\\nof their neighbours, did not wait for the Scyths to invade them, but\\nsent a herald to forbid them to cross their borders, and to forewarn\\nthem, that, if they made the attempt, it would be resisted by force\\nof arms. The Agathyrsi then proceeded to the frontier, to defend their\\ncountry against the invaders. As for the other nations, the Melanchaeni,\\nthe Androphagi, and the Neuri, instead of defending themselves, when\\nthe Scyths and Persians overran their lands, they forgot their threats\\nand fled away in confusion to the deserts lying towards the north.\\nThe Scythians, when the Agathyrsi forbade them to enter their country,\\nrefrained; and led the Persians back from the Neurian district into\\ntheir own land. \\n\\nThis had gone on so long, and seemed so interminable, that Darius\\nat last sent a horseman to Idanthyrsus, the Scythian king, with the\\nfollowing message:- \"Thou strange man, why dost thou keep on flying\\nbefore me, when there are two things thou mightest do so easily? If\\nthou deemest thyself able to resist my arms, cease thy wanderings\\nand come, let us engage in battle. Or if thou art conscious that my\\nstrength is greater than thine- even so thou shouldest cease to run\\naway- thou hast but to bring thy lord earth and water, and to come\\nat once to a conference.\" \\n\\nTo this message Idanthyrsus, the Scythian king, replied:- \"This is\\nmy way, Persian. I never fear men or fly from them. I have not done\\nso in times past, nor do I now fly from thee. There is nothing new\\nor strange in what I do; I only follow my common mode of life in peaceful\\nyears. Now I will tell thee why I do not at once join battle with\\nthee. We Scythians have neither towns nor cultivated lands, which\\nmight induce us, through fear of their being taken or ravaged, to\\nbe in any hurry to fight with you. If, however, you must needs come\\nto blows with us speedily, look you now, there are our fathers\\' tombs-\\nseek them out, and attempt to meddle with them- then ye shall see\\nwhether or no we will fight with you. Till ye do this, be sure we\\nshall not join battle, unless it pleases us. This is my answer to\\nthe challenge to fight. As for lords, I acknowledge only Jove my ancestor,\\nand Vesta, the Scythian queen. Earth and water, the tribute thou askedst,\\nI do not send, but thou shalt soon receive more suitable gifts. Last\\nof all, in return for thy calling thyself my lord, I say to thee,\\n\\'Go weep.\\'\" (This is what men mean by the Scythian mode of speech.)\\nSo the herald departed, bearing this message to Darius. \\n\\nWhen the Scythian kings heard the name of slavery they were filled\\nwith rage, and despatched the division under Scopasis to which the\\nSauromatae were joined, with orders that they should seek a conference\\nwith the Ionians, who had been left at the Ister to guard the bridge.\\nMeanwhile the Scythians who remained behind resolved no longer to\\nlead the Persians hither and thither about their country, but to fall\\nupon them whenever they should be at their meals. So they waited till\\nsuch times, and then did as they had determined. In these combats\\nthe Scythian horse always put to flight the horse of the enemy; these\\nlast, however, when routed, fell back upon their foot, who never failed\\nto afford them support; while the Scythians, on their side, as soon\\nas they had driven the horse in, retired again, for fear of the foot.\\nBy night too the Scythians made many similar attacks. \\n\\nThere was one very strange thing which greatly advantaged the Persians,\\nand was of equal disservice to the Scyths, in these assaults on the\\nPersian camp. This was the braying of the asses and the appearance\\nof the mules. For, as I observed before, the land of the Scythians\\nproduces neither ass nor mule, and contains no single specimen of\\neither animal, by reason of the cold. So, when the asses brayed, they\\nfrightened the Scythian cavalry; and often, in the middle of a charge,\\nthe horses, hearing the noise made by the asses, would take fright\\nand wheel round, pricking up their ears, and showing astonishment.\\nThis was owing to their having never heard the noise, or seen the\\nform, of the animal before: and it was not without some little influence\\non the progress of the war. \\n\\nThe Scythians, when they perceived signs that the Persians were becoming\\nalarmed, took steps to induce them not to quit Scythia, in the hope,\\nif they stayed, of inflicting on them the greater injury, when their\\nsupplies should altogether fail. To effect this, they would leave\\nsome of their cattle exposed with the herdsmen, while they themselves\\nmoved away to a distance: the Persians would make a foray, and take\\nthe beasts, whereupon they would be highly elated. \\n\\nThis they did several times, until at last Darius was at his wits\\'\\nend; hereon the Scythian princes, understanding how matters stood,\\ndespatched a herald to the Persian camp with presents for the king:\\nthese were, a bird, a mouse, a frog, and five arrows. The Persians\\nasked the bearer to tell them what these gifts might mean, but he\\nmade answer that he had no orders except to deliver them, and return\\nagain with all speed. If the Persians were wise, he added, they would\\nfind out the meaning for themselves. So when they heard this, they\\nheld a council to consider the matter. \\n\\nDarius gave it as his opinion that the Scyths intended a surrender\\nof themselves and their country, both land and water, into his hands.\\nThis he conceived to be the meaning of the gifts, because the mouse\\nis an inhabitant of the earth, and eats the same food as man, while\\nthe frog passes his life in the water; the bird bears a great resemblance\\nto the horse, and the arrows might signify the surrender of all their\\npower. To the explanation of Darius, Gobryas, one of the seven conspirators\\nagainst the Magus, opposed another which was as follows:- \"Unless,\\nPersians, ye can turn into birds and fly up into the sky, or become\\nmice and burrow under the ground, or make yourselves frogs, and take\\nrefuge in the fens, ye will never make escape from this land, but\\ndie pierced by our arrows. Such were meanings which the Persians assigned\\nto the gifts. \\n\\nThe single division of the Scyths, which in the early part of the\\nwar had been appointed to keep guard about the Palus Maeotis, and\\nhad now been sent to get speech of the Ionians stationed at the Ister,\\naddressed them, on reaching the bridge, in these words- \"Men of Ionia,\\nwe bring you freedom, if ye will only do as we recommend. Darius,\\nwe understand, enjoined you to keep your guard here at this bridge\\njust sixty days; then, if he did not appear, you were to return home.\\nNow, therefore, act so as to be free from blame, alike in his sight,\\nand in ours. Tarry here the appointed time, and at the end go your\\nways.\" Having said this, and received a promise from the Ionians to\\ndo as they desired, the Scythians hastened back with all possible\\nspeed. \\n\\nAfter the sending of the gifts to Darius, the part of the Scythian\\narmy which had not marched to the Ister, drew out in battle array\\nhorse and foot against the Persians, and seemed about to come to an\\nengagement. But as they stood in battle array, it chanced that a hare\\nstarted up between them and the Persians, and set to running; when\\nimmediately all the Scyths who saw it, rushed off in pursuit, with\\ngreat confusion and loud cries and shouts. Darius, hearing the noise,\\ninquired the cause of it, and was told that the Scythians were all\\nengaged in hunting a hare. On this he turned to those with whom he\\nwas wont to converse, and said:- \"These men do indeed despise us utterly:\\nand now I see that Gobryas was right about the Scythian gifts. As,\\ntherefore, his opinion is now mine likewise, it is time we form some\\nwise plan whereby we may secure ourselves a safe return to our homes.\"\\n\"Ah! sire,\" Gobryas rejoined, \"I was well nigh sure, ere I came here,\\nthat this was an impracticable race- since our coming I am yet more\\nconvinced of it, especially now that I see them making game of us.\\nMy advice is, therefore, that, when night falls, we light our fires\\nas we are wont to do at other times, and leaving behind us on some\\npretext that portion of our army which is weak and unequal to hardship,\\ntaking care also to leave our asses tethered, retreat from Scythia,\\nbefore our foes march forward to the Ister and destroy the bridge,\\nor the Ionians come to any resolution which may lead to our ruin.\"\\n\\nSo Gobryas advised; and when night came, Darius followed his counsel,\\nand leaving his sick soldiers, and those whose loss would be of least\\naccount, with the asses also tethered about the camp, marched away.\\nThe asses were left that their noise might be heard: the men, really\\nbecause they were sick and useless, but under the pretence that he\\nwas about to fall upon the Scythians with the flower of his troops,\\nand that they meanwhile were to guard his camp for him. Having thus\\ndeclared his plans to the men whom he was deserting, and having caused\\nthe fires to be lighted, Darius set forth, and marched hastily towards\\nthe Ister. The asses, aware of the departure of the host, brayed louder\\nthan ever; and the Scythians, hearing the sound, entertained no doubt\\nof the Persians being still in the same place. \\n\\nWhen day dawned, the men who had been left behind, perceiving that\\nthey were betrayed by Darius, stretched out their hands towards the\\nScythians, and spoke as. befitted their situation. The enemy no sooner\\nheard, than they quickly joined all their troops in one, and both\\nportions of the Scythian army- alike that which consisted of a single\\ndivision, and that made up of two- accompanied by all their allies,\\nthe Sauromatae, the Budini, and the Geloni, set off in pursuit, and\\nmade straight for the Ister. As, however, the Persian army was chiefly\\nfoot, and had no knowledge of the routes, which are not cut out in\\nScythia; while the Scyths were all horsemen and well acquainted with\\nthe shortest way; it so happened that the two armies missed one another,\\nand the Scythians, getting far ahead of their adversaries, came first\\nto the bridge. Finding that the Persians were not yet arrived, they\\naddressed the Ionians, who were aboard their ships, in these words:-\\n\"Men of Ionia, the number of your days is out, and ye do wrong to\\nremain. Fear doubtless has kept you here hitherto: now, however, you\\nmay safely break the bridge, and hasten back to your homes, rejoicing\\nthat you are free, and thanking for it the gods and the Scythians.\\nYour former lord and master we undertake so to handle, that he will\\nnever again make war upon any one.\" \\n\\nThe Ionians now held a council. Miltiades the Athenian, who was king\\nof the Chersonesites upon the Hellespont, and their commander at the\\nIster, recommended the other generals to do as the Scythians wished,\\nand restore freedom to Ionia. But Histiaeus the Milesian opposed this\\nadvice. \"It is through Darius,\" he said, \"that we enjoy our thrones\\nin our several states. If his power be overturned, I cannot continue\\nlord of Miletus, nor ye of your cities. For there is not one of them\\nwhich will not prefer democracy to kingly rule.\" Then the other captains,\\nwho, till Histiaeus spoke, were about to vote with Miltiades, changed\\ntheir minds, and declared in favour of the last speaker.\\n\\nThe following were the voters on this occasion- all of them men who\\nstood high in the esteem of the Persian king: the tyrants of the Hellespont-\\nDaphnis of Abydos, Hippoclus of Lampsacus, Herophantus of Parium,\\nMetrodorus of Proconnesus, Aristagoras of Cyzicus, and Ariston of\\nByzantium; the Ionian princes- Strattis of Chios, Aeaces of Samos,\\nLaodamas of Phocaea, and Histiaeus of Miletus, the man who had opposed\\nMiltiades. Only one Aeolian of note was present, to wit, Aristagoras\\nof Cyme. \\n\\nHaving resolved to follow the advice of Histiaeus, the Greek leaders\\nfurther determined to speak and act as follows. In order to appear\\nto the Scythians to be doing something, when in fact they were doing\\nnothing of consequence, and likewise to prevent them from forcing\\na passage across the Ister by the bridge, they resolved to break up\\nthe part of the bridge which abutted on Scythia, to the distance of\\na bowshot from the river bank; and to assure the Scythians, while\\nthe demolition was proceeding, that there was nothing which they would\\nnot do to pleasure them. Such were the additions made to the resolution\\nof Histiaeus; and then Histiaeus himself stood forth and made answer\\nto the Scyths in the name of all the Greeks.- \"Good is the advice\\nwhich ye have brought us, Scythians, and well have ye done to come\\nhere with such speed. Your efforts have now put us into the right\\npath; and our efforts shall not be wanting to advance your cause.\\nYour own eyes see that we are engaged in breaking the bridge; and,\\nbelieve us, we will work zealously to procure our own freedom. Meantime,\\nwhile we labour here at our task, be it your business to seek them\\nout, and, when found, for our sakes, as well as your own, to visit\\nthem with the vengeance which they so well deserve.\" \\n\\nAgain the Scyths put faith in the promises of the Ionian chiefs, and\\nretraced their steps, hoping to fall in with the Persians. They missed,\\nhowever, the enemy\\'s whole line of march; their own former acts being\\nto blame for it. Had they not ravaged all the pasturages of that region,\\nand filled in all the wells, they would have easily found the Persians\\nwhenever they chose. But, as it turned out, the measures which seemed\\nto them so wisely planned were exactly what caused their failure.\\nThey took a route where water was to be found and fodder could be\\ngot for their horses, and on this track sought their adversaries,\\nexpecting that they too would retreat through regions where these\\nthings were to be obtained. The Persians, however, kept strictly to\\nthe line of their former march, never for a moment departing from\\nit; and even so gained the bridge with difficulty. It was night when\\nthey arrived, and their terror, when they found the bridge broken\\nup, was great; for they thought that perhaps the Ionians had deserted\\nthem. \\n\\nNow there was in the army of Darius a certain man, an Egyptian, who\\nhad a louder voice than any other man in the world. This person was\\nbid by Darius to stand at the water\\'s edge, and call Histiaeus the\\nMilesian. The fellow did as he was bid; and Histiaeus, hearing him\\nat the very first summons, brought the fleet to assist in conveying\\nthe army across, and once more made good the bridge. \\n\\nBy these means the Persians escaped from Scythia, while the Scyths\\nsought for them in vain, again missing their track. And hence the\\nScythians are accustomed to say of the Ionians, by way of reproach,\\nthat, if they be looked upon as freemen, they are the basest and most\\ndastardly of all mankind- but if they be considered as under servitude,\\nthey are the faithfullest of slaves, and the most fondly at. to their\\nlords. \\n\\nDarius, having passed through Thrace, reached Sestos in the Chersonese,\\nwhence he crossed by the help of his fleet into Asia, leaving a Persian,\\nnamed Megabazus, commander on the European side. This was the man\\non whom Darius once conferred special honour by a compliment which\\nhe paid him before all the Persians. was about to eat some pomegranates,\\nand had opened the first, when his brother Artabanus asked him \"what\\nhe would like to have in as great plenty as the seeds of the pomegranate?\"\\nDarius answered- \"Had I as many men like Megabazus as there are seeds\\nhere, it would please me better than to be lord of Greece.\" Such was\\nthe compliment wherewith Darius honoured the general to whom at this\\ntime he gave the command of the troops left in Europe, amounting in\\nall to some eighty thousand men. \\n\\nThis same Megabazus got himself an undying remembrance among the Hellespontians,\\nby a certain speech which he made. It came to his knowledge, while\\nhe was staying at Byzantium, that the Chalcedonians made their settlement\\nseventeen years earlier than the Byzantines. \"Then,\" said he, \"the\\nChalcedonians must at that time have been labouring under blindness-\\notherwise, when so far more excellent a site was open to them, they\\nwould never have chosen one so greatly inferior.\" Megabazus now, having\\nbeen appointed to take the command upon the Hellespont, employed himself\\nin the reduction of all those states which had not of their own accord\\njoined the Medes. \\n\\nAbout this very time another great expedition was undertaken against\\nLibya, on a pretext which I will relate when I have premised certain\\nparticulars. The descendants of the Argonauts in the third generation,\\ndriven out of Lemnos by the Pelasgi who carried off the Athenian women\\nfrom Brauron, took ship and went to Lacedaemon, where, seating themselves\\non Mount Taygetum, they proceeded to kindle their fires. The Lacedaemonians,\\nseeing this, sent a herald to inquire of them \"who they were, and\\nfrom what region they had come\"; whereupon they made answer, \"that\\nthey were Minyae, sons of the heroes by whom the ship Argo was manned;\\nfor these persons had stayed awhile in Lemnos, and had there become\\ntheir progenitors.\" On hearing this account of their descent, the\\nLacedaemonians sent to them a second time, and asked \"what was their\\nobject in coming to Lacedaemon, and there kindling their fires?\" They\\nanswered, \"that, driven from their own land by the Pelasgi, they had\\ncome, as was most reasonable, to their fathers; and their wish was\\nto dwell with them in their country, partake their privileges, and\\nobtain allotments of land. It seemed good to the Lacedaemonians to\\nreceive the Minyae among them on their own terms; to assign them lands,\\nand enrol them in their tribes. What chiefly moved them to this was\\nthe consideration that the sons of Tyndarus had sailed on board the\\nArgo. The Minyae, on their part, forthwith married Spartan wives,\\nand gave the wives, whom they had married in Lemnos, to Spartan husbands.\\n\\nHowever, before much time had elapsed, the Minyae began to wax wanton,\\ndemanded to share the throne, and committed other impieties: whereupon\\nthe Lacedaemonians passed on them sentence of death, and, seizing\\nthem, cast them into prison. Now the Lacedaemonians never put criminals\\nto death in the daytime, but always at night. When the Minyae, accordingly,\\nwere about to suffer, their wives, who were not only citizens, but\\ndaughters of the chief men among the Spartans, entreated to be allowed\\nto enter the prison, and have some talk with their lords; and the\\nSpartans, not expecting any fraud from such a quarter, granted their\\nrequest. The women entered the prison. gave their own clothes to their\\nhusbands, and received theirs in exchange: after which the Minyae,\\ndressed in their wives\\' garments, and thus passing for women, went\\nforth. Having effected their escape in this manner, they seated themselves\\nonce more upon Taygetum.own land \\n\\nIt happened that at this very time Theras, son of Autesion (whose\\nfather Tisamenus was the son of Thersander, and grandson of Polynices),\\nwas about to lead out a colony from Lacedaemon This Theras, by birth\\na Cadmeian, was uncle on the mother\\'s side to the two sons of Aristodemus,\\nProcles and Eurysthenes, and, during their infancy, administered in\\ntheir right the royal power. When his nephews, however, on attaining\\nto man\\'s estate, took the government, Theras, who could not bear to\\nbe under the authority of others after he had wielded authority so\\nlong himself, resolved to leave Sparta and cross the sea to join his\\nkindred. There were in the island now called Thera, but at that time\\nCalliste, certain descendants of Membliarus, the son of Poeciles,\\na Phoenician. (For Cadmus, the son of Agenor, when he was sailing\\nin search of Europe, made a landing on this island; and, either because\\nthe country pleased him, or because he had a purpose in so doing,\\nleft there a number of Phoenicians, and with them his own kinsman\\nMembliarus. Calliste had been inhabited by this race for eight generations\\nof men, before the arrival of Theras from Lacedaemon.) \\n\\nTheras now, having with him a certain number of men from each of the\\ntribes, was setting forth on his expedition hitherward. Far from intending\\nto drive out the former inhabitants, he regarded them as his near\\nkin, and meant to settle among them. It happened that just at this\\ntime the Minyae, having escaped from their prison, had taken up their\\nstation upon Mount Taygetum; and the Lacedaemonians, wishing to destroy\\nthem, were considering what was best to be done, when Theras begged\\ntheir lives, undertaking to remove them from the territory. His prayer\\nbeing granted, he took ship, and sailed, with three triaconters, to\\njoin the descendants of Membliarus. He was not, however, accompanied\\nby all the Minyae, but only by some few of them. The greater number\\nfled to the land of the Paroreats and Caucons, whom they drove out,\\nthemselves occupying the region in six bodies, by which were afterwards\\nbuilt the towns of Lepreum, Macistus, Phryxae, Pyrgus, Epium, and\\nNudium; whereof the greater part were in my day demolished by the\\nEleans. \\n\\nThe island was called Thera after the name of its founder. This same\\nTheras had a son, who refused to cross the sea with him; Theras therefore\\nleft him behind, \"a sheep,\" as he said, \"among wolves.\" From this\\nspeech his son came to be called Oeolycus, a name which afterwards\\ngrew to be the only one by which he was known. This Oeolycus was the\\nfather of Aegeus, from whom sprang the Aegidae, a great tribe in Sparta.\\nThe men of this tribe lost at one time all their children, whereupon\\nthey were bidden by an oracle to build a temple to the furies of Laius\\nand Oedipus; they complied, and the mortality ceased. The same thing\\nhappened in Thera to the descendants of these men. \\n\\nThus far the history is delivered without variation both by the Theraeans\\nand the Lacedaemonians; but from this point we have only the Theraean\\nnarrative. Grinus (they say), the son of Aesanius, a descendant of\\nTheras, and king of the island of Thera, went to Delphi to offer a\\nhecatomb on behalf of his native city. He was accompanied by a large\\nnumber of the citizens, and among the rest by Battus, the son of Polymnestus,\\nwho belonged to the Minyan family of the Euphemidae. On Grinus consulting\\nthe oracle about sundry matters, the Pythoness gave him for answer,\\n\"that he should found a city in Libya.\" Grinus replied to this: \"I,\\nO king! am too far advanced in years, and too inactive, for such a\\nwork. Bid one of these youngsters undertake it.\" As he spoke, he pointed\\ntowards Battus; and thus the matter rested for that time. When the\\nembassy returned to Thera, small account was taken of the oracle by\\nthe Theraeans, as they were quite ignorant where Libya was, and were\\nnot so venturesome as to send out a colony in the dark. \\n\\nSeven years passed from the utterance of the oracle, and not a drop\\nof rain fell in Thera: all the trees in the island, except one, were\\nkilled with the drought. The Theraeans upon this sent to Delphi, and\\nwere reminded reproachfully that they had never colonised Libya. So,\\nas there was no help for it, they sent messengers to Crete, to inquire\\nwhether any of the Cretans, or of the strangers sojourning among them,\\nhad ever travelled as far as Libya: and these messengers of theirs,\\nin their wanderings about the island, among other places visited Itanus,\\nwhere they fell in with a man, whose name was Corobius, a dealer in\\npurple. In answer to their inquiries, he told them that contrary winds\\nhad once carried him to Libya, where he had gone ashore on a certain\\nisland which was named Platea. So they hired this man\\'s services,\\nand took him back with them to Thera. A few persons then sailed from\\nThera to reconnoitre. Guided by Corobius to the island of Platea,\\nthey left him there with provisions for a certain number of months,\\nand returned home with all speed to give their countrymen an account\\nof the island. \\n\\nDuring their absence, which was prolonged beyond the time that had\\nbeen agreed upon, Corobius provisions failed him. He was relieved,\\nhowever, after a while by a Samian vessel, under the command of a\\nman named Colaeus, which, on its way to Egypt, was forced to put in\\nat Platea. The crew, informed by Corobius of all the circumstances,\\nleft him sufficient food for a year. They themselves quitted the island;\\nand, anxious to reach Egypt, made sail in that direction, but were\\ncarried out of their course by a gale of wind from the east. The storm\\nnot abating, they were driven past the Pillars of Hercules, and at\\nlast, by some special guiding providence, reached Tartessus. This\\ntrading town was in those days a virgin port, unfrequented by the\\nmerchants. The Samians, in consequence, made by the return voyage\\na profit greater than any Greeks before their day, excepting Sostratus,\\nson of Laodamas, an Eginetan, with whom no one else can compare. From\\nthe tenth part of their gains, amounting to six talents, the Samians\\nmade a brazen vessel, in shape like an Argive wine-bowl, adorned with\\nthe heads of griffins standing out in high relief. This bowl, supported\\nby three kneeling colossal figures in bronze, of the height of seven\\ncubits, was placed as an offering in the temple of Juno at Samos.\\nThe aid given to Corobius was the original cause of that close friendship\\nwhich afterwards united the Cyrenaeans and Theraeans with the Samians.\\n\\nThe Theraeans who had left Corobius at Platea, when they reached Thera,\\ntold their countrymen that they had colonised an island on the coast\\nof Libya. They of Thera, upon this, resolved that men should be sent\\nto join the colony from each of their seven districts, and that the\\nbrothers in every family should draw lots to determine who were to\\ngo. Battus was chosen to be king and leader of the colony. So these\\nmen departed for Platea on board of two penteconters. \\n\\nSuch is the account which the Theraeans give. In the sequel of the\\nhistory their accounts tally with those of the people of Cyrene; but\\nin what they relate of Battus these two nations differ most widely.\\nThe following is the Cyrenaic story. There was once a king named Etearchus,\\nwho ruled over Axus, a city in Crete, and had a daughter named Phronima.\\nThis girl\\'s mother having died, Etearchus married a second wife; who\\nno sooner took up her abode in his house than she proved a true step-mother\\nto poor Phronima, always vexing her, and contriving against her every\\nsort of mischief. At last she taxed her with light conduct; and Etearchus,\\npersuaded by his wife that the charge was true, bethought himself\\nof a most barbarous mode of punishment. There was a certain Theraean,\\nnamed Themison, a merchant, living at Axus. This man Etearchus invited\\nto be his friend and guest, and then induced him to swear that he\\nwould do him any service he might require. No sooner had he given\\nthe promise, than the king fetched Phronima, and, delivering her into\\nhis hands, told him to carry her away and throw her into the sea.\\nHereupon Themison, full of indignation at the fraud whereby his oath\\nhad been procured, dissolved forthwith the friendship, and, taking\\nthe girl with him, sailed away from Crete. Having reached the open\\nmain, to acquit himself of the obligation under which he was laid\\nby his oath to Etearchus, he fastened ropes about the damsel, and,\\nletting her down into the sea, drew her up again, and so made sail\\nfor Thera. \\n\\nAt Thera, Polymnestus, one of the chief citizens of the place, took\\nPhronima to be his concubine. The fruit of this union was a son, who\\nstammered and had a lisp in his speech. According to the Cyrenaeans\\nand Theraeans the name given to the boy was Battus: in my opinion,\\nhowever, he was called at the first something else, and only got the\\nname of Battus after his arrival in Libya, assuming it either in consequence\\nof the words addressed to him by the Delphian oracle, or on account\\nof the office which he held. For, in the Libyan tongue, the word \"Battus\"\\nmeans \"a king.\" And this, I think, was the reason the Pythoness addressed\\nhim as she did: she said he was to be a king in Libya, and so she\\nused the Libyan word in speaking to him. For after he had grown to\\nman\\'s estate, he made a journey to Delphi, to consult the oracle about\\nhis voice; when, upon his putting his question, the Pythoness thus\\nreplied to him:- \\n\\nBattus, thou camest to ask of thy voice; but Phoebus Apollo\\n\\nBids thee establish a city in Libya, abounding in fleeces; which was\\nas if she had said in her own tongue, \"King, thou camest to ask of\\nthy voice.\" Then he replied, \"Mighty lord, I did indeed come hither\\nto consult thee about my voice, but thou speakest to me of quite other\\nmatters, bidding me colonise Libya- an impossible thing! what power\\nhave I? what followers?\" Thus he spake, but he did not persuade the\\nPythoness to give him any other response; so, when he found that she\\npersisted in her former answer, he left her speaking, and set out\\non his return to Thera. \\n\\nAfter a while, everything began to go wrong both with Battus and with\\nthe rest of the Theraeans, whereupon these last, ignorant of the cause\\nof their sufferings, sent to Delphi to inquire for what reason they\\nwere afflicted. The Pythoness in reply told them \"that if they and\\nBattus would make a settlement at Cyrene in Libya, things would go\\nbetter with them.\" Upon this the Theraeans sent out Battus with two\\npenteconters, and with these he proceeded to Libya, but within a little\\ntime, not knowing what else to do, the men returned and arrived off\\nThera. The Theraeans, when they saw the vessels approaching, received\\nthem with showers of missiles, would not allow them to come near the\\nshore, and ordered the men to sail back from whence they came. Thus\\ncompelled to return, they settled on an island near the Libyan coast,\\nwhich (as I have already said) was called Platea. In size it is reported\\nto have been about equal to the city of Cyrene, as it now stands.\\n\\nIn this place they continued two years, but at the end of that time,\\nas their ill luck still followed them, they left the island to the\\ncare of one of their number, and went in a body to Delphi, where they\\nmade complaint at the shrine to the effect that, notwithstanding they\\nhad colonised Libya, they prospered as poorly as before. Hereon the\\nPythoness made them the following answer:- \\n\\nKnowest thou better than I, fair Libya abounding in fleeces?\\n\\nBetter the stranger than he who has trod it? Oh! clever Theraeans!\\nBattus and his friends, when they heard this, sailed back to Platea:\\nit was plain the god would not hold them acquitted of the colony till\\nthey were absolutely in Libya. So, taking with them the man whom they\\nhad left upon the island, they made a settlement on the mainland directly\\nopposite Platea, fixing themselves at a place called Aziris, which\\nis closed in on both sides by the most beautiful hills, and on one\\nside is washed by a river. \\n\\nHere they remained six years, at the end of which time the Libyans\\ninduced them to move, promising that they would lead them to a better\\nsituation. So the Greeks left Aziris and were conducted by the Libyans\\ntowards the west, their journey being so arranged, by the calculation\\nof their guides, that they passed in the night the most beautiful\\ndistrict of that whole country, which is the region called Irasa.\\nThe Libyans brought them to a spring, which goes by the name of Apollo\\'s\\nfountain, and told them- \"Here, Grecians, is the proper place for\\nyou to settle; for here the sky leaks.\" \\n\\nDuring the lifetime of Battus, the founder of the colony, who reigned\\nforty years, and during that of his son Arcesilaus, who reigned sixteen,\\nthe Cyrenaeans continued at the same level, neither more nor fewer\\nin number than they were at the first. But in the reign of the third\\nking, Battus, surnamed the Happy, the advice of the Pythoness brought\\nGreeks from every quarter into Libya, to join the settlement. The\\nCyrenaeans had offered to all comers a share in their lands; and the\\noracle had spoken as follows:- \\n\\nHe that is backward to share in the pleasant Libyan acres,\\n\\nSooner or later, I warn him, will feel regret at his folly. Thus a\\ngreat multitude were collected together to Cyrene, and the Libyans\\nof the neighbourhood found themselves stripped of large portions of\\ntheir lands. So they, and their king Adicran, being robbed and insulted\\nby the Cyrenaeans, sent messengers to Egypt, and put themselves under\\nthe rule of Apries, the Egyptian monarch; who, upon this, levied a\\nvast army of Egyptians, and sent them against Cyrene. The inhabitants\\nof that place left their walls and marched out in force to the district\\nof Irasa, where, near the spring called Theste, they engaged the Egyptian\\nhost, and defeated it. The Egyptians, who had never before made trial\\nof the prowess of the Greeks, and so thought but meanly of them, were\\nrouted with such slaughter that but a very few of them ever got back\\nhome. For this reason, the subjects of Apries, who laid the blame\\nof the defeat on him, revolted from his authority. \\n\\nThis Battus left a son called Arcesilaus, who, when he came to the\\nthrone, had dissensions with his brothers, which ended in their quitting\\nhim and departing to another region of Libya, where, after consulting\\namong themselves, they founded the city, which is still called by\\nthe name then given to it, Barca. At the same time they endeavoured\\nto induce the Libyans to revolt from Cyrene. Not long afterwards Arcesilaus\\nmade an expedition against the Libyans who had received his brothers\\nand been prevailed upon to revolt; and they, fearing his power, fled\\nto their countrymen who dwelt towards the east. Arcesilaus pursued,\\nand chased them to a place called Leucon, which is in Libya, where\\nthe Libyans resolved to risk a battle. Accordingly they engaged the\\nCyrenaeans, and defeated them so entirely that as many as seven thousand\\nof their heavy-armed were slain in the fight. Arcesilaus, after this\\nblow, fell sick, and, whilst he was under the influence of a draught\\nwhich he had taken, was strangled by Learchus, one of his brothers.\\nThis Learchus was afterwards entrapped by Eryxo, the widow of Arcesilaus,\\nand put to death. \\n\\nBattus, Arcesilaus\\' son, succeeded to the kingdom, a lame man, who\\nlimped in his walk. Their late calamities now induced the Cyrenaeans\\nto send to Delphi and inquire of the god what form of government they\\nhad best set up to secure themselves prosperity. The Pythoness answered\\nby recommending them to fetch an arbitrator from Mantinea in Arcadia.\\nAccordingly they sent; and the Mantineans gave them a man named Demonax,\\na person of high repute among the citizens; who, on his arrival at\\nCyrene, having first made himself acquainted with all the circumstances,\\nproceeded to enrol the people in three tribes. One he made to consist\\nof the Theraeans and their vassals; another of the Peloponnesians\\nand Cretans; and a third of the various islanders. Besides this, he\\ndeprived the king Battus of his former privileges, only reserving\\nfor him certain sacred lands and offices; while, with respect to the\\npowers which had hitherto been exercised by the king, he gave them\\nall into the hands of the people. \\n\\nThus matters rested during the lifetime of this Battus, but when his\\nson Arcesilaus came to the throne, great disturbance arose about the\\nprivileges. For Arcesilaus, son of Battus the lame and Pheretima,\\nrefused to submit to the arrangements of Demonax the Mantinean, and\\nclaimed all the powers of his forefathers. In the contention which\\nfollowed Arcesilaus was worsted, whereupon he fled to Samos, while\\nhis mother took refuge at Salamis in the island of Cyprus. Salamis\\nwas at that time ruled by Evelthon, the same who offered at Delphi\\nthe censer which is in the treasury of the Corinthians, a work deserving\\nof admiration. Of him Pheretima made request that he would give her\\nan army whereby she and her son might regain Cyrene. But Evelthon,\\npreferring to give her anything rather than an army, made her various\\npresents. Pheretima accepted them all, saying, as she took them: \"Good\\nis this too, O king! but better were it to give me the army which\\nI crave at thy hands.\" Finding that she repeated these words each\\ntime that he presented her with a gift, Evelthon at last sent her\\na golden spindle and distaff, with the wool ready for spinning. Again\\nshe uttered the same speech as before, whereupon Evelthon rejoined-\"These\\nare the gifts I present to women, not armies.\" \\n\\nAt Samos, meanwhile, Arcesilaus was collecting troops by the promise\\nof granting them lands. Having in this way drawn together a vast host,\\nhe sent to Delphi to consult the oracle about his restoration. The\\nanswer of the Pythoness was this: \"Loxias grants thy race to rule\\nover Cyrene, till four kings Battus, four Arcesilaus by name, have\\npassed away. Beyond this term of eight generations of men, he warns\\nyou not to seek to extend your reign. Thou, for thy part, be gentle,\\nwhen thou art restored. If thou findest the oven full of jars, bake\\nnot the jars; but be sure to speed them on their way. If, however,\\nthou heatest the oven, then avoid the island else thou wilt die thyself,\\nand with thee the most beautiful bull.\" \\n\\nSo spake the Pythoness. Arcesilaus upon this returned to Cyrene, taking\\nwith him the troops which he had raised in Samos. There he obtained\\npossession of the supreme power; whereupon, forgetful of the oracle,\\nhe took proceedings against those who had driven him into banishment.\\nSome of them fled from him and quitted the country for good; others\\nfell into his hands and were sent to suffer death in Cyprus. These\\nlast happening on their passage to put in through stress of weather\\nat Cnidus, the Cnidians rescued them, and sent them off to Thera.\\nAnother body found a refuge in the great tower of Aglomachus, a private\\nedifice, and were there destroyed by Arcesilaus, who heaped wood around\\nthe place, and burnt them to death. Aware, after the deed was done,\\nthat this was what the Pythoness meant when she warned him, if he\\nfound the jars in the oven, not to bake them, he withdrew himself\\nof his own accord from the city of Cyrene, believing that to be the\\nisland of the oracle, and fearing to die as had been prophesied. Being\\nmarried to a relation of his own, a daughter of Alazir, at that time\\nking of the Barcaeans, he took up his abode with him. At Barca, however,\\ncertain of the citizens, together with a number of Cyrenaean exiles,\\nrecognising him as he walked in the forum, killed him; they slew also\\nat the same time Alazir, his father-in-law. So Arcesilaus, wittingly\\nor unwittingly, disobeyed the oracle, and thereby fulfilled his destiny.\\n\\nPheretima, the mother of Arcesilaus, during the time that her son,\\nafter working his own ruin, dwelt at Barca, continued to enjoy all\\nhis privileges at Cyrene, managing the government, and taking her\\nseat at the council-board. No sooner, however, did she hear of the\\ndeath of her son at Barca, than leaving Cyrene, she fled in haste\\nto Egypt. Arcesilaus had claims for service done to Cambyses, son\\nof Cyrus; since it was by him that Cyrene was put under the Persian\\nyoke, and a rate of tribute agreed upon. Pheretima therefore went\\nstraight to Egypt, and presenting herself as a suppliant before Aryandes,\\nentreated him to avenge her wrongs. Her son, she said, had met his\\ndeath on account of his being so well affected towards the Medes.\\n\\nNow Aryandes had been made governor of Egypt by Cambyses. He it was\\nwho in after times was punished with death by Darius for seeking to\\nrival him. Aware, by report and also by his own eyesight, that Darius\\nwished to leave a memorial of himself, such as no king had ever left\\nbefore, Aryandes resolved to follow his example, and did so, till\\nhe got his reward. Darius had refined gold to the last perfection\\nof purity in order to have coins struck of it: Aryandes, in his Egyptian\\ngovernment, did the very same with silver, so that to this day there\\nis no such pure silver anywhere as the Aryandic. Darius, when this\\ncame to his ears, brought another charge, a charge of rebellion, against\\nAryandes, and put him to death. \\n\\nAt the time of which we are speaking Aryandes, moved with compassion\\nfor Pheretima, granted her all the forces which there were in Egypt,\\nboth land and sea. The command of the army he gave to Amasis, a Maraphian;\\nwhile Badres, one of the tribe of the Pasargadae, was appointed to\\nlead the fleet. Before the expedition, however, left Egypt, he sent\\na herald to Barca to inquire who it was that had slain king Arcesilaus.\\nThe Barcaeans replied \"that they, one and all, acknowledged the deed-\\nArcesilaus had done them many and great injuries.\" After receiving\\nthis reply, Aryandes gave the troops orders to march with Pheretima.\\nSuch was the cause which served as a pretext for this expedition:\\nits real object was, I believe, the subjugation of Libya. For Libya\\nis inhabited by many and various races, and of these but very few\\nwere subjects of the Persian king, while by far the larger number\\nheld Darius in no manner of respect. \\n\\nThe Libyans dwell in the order which I will now describe. Beginning\\non the side of Egypt, the first Libyans are the Adyrmachidae These\\npeople have, in most points, the same customs as the Egyptians, but\\nuse the costume of the Libyans. Their women wear on each leg a ring\\nmade of bronze; they let their hair grow long, and when they catch\\nany vermin on their persons, bite it and throw it away. In this they\\ndiffer from all the other Libyans. They are also the only tribe with\\nwhom the custom obtains of bringing all women about to become brides\\nbefore the king, that he may choose such as are agreeable to him.\\nThe Adyrmachidae extend from the borders of Egypt to the harbour called\\nPort Plynus. \\n\\nNext to the Adyrmachidae are the Gilligammae, who inhabit the country\\nwestward as far as the island of Aphrodisias. Off this tract is the\\nisland of Platea, which the Cyrenaeans colonised. Here too, upon the\\nmainland, are Port Menelaus, and Aziris, where the Cyrenaeans once\\nlived. The Silphium begins to grow in this region, extending from\\nthe island of Platea on the one side to the mouth of the Syrtis on\\nthe other. The customs of the Gilligammae are like those of the rest\\nof their countrymen. \\n\\nThe Asbystae adjoin the Gilligammae upon the west. They inhabit the\\nregions above Cyrene, but do not reach to the coast, which belongs\\nto the Cyrenaeans. Four-horse chariots are in more common use among\\nthem than among any other Libyans. In most of their customs they ape\\nthe manners of the Cyrenaeans. \\n\\nWestward of the Asbystae dwell the Auschisae, who possess the country\\nabove Barca, reaching, however, to the sea at the place called Euesperides.\\nIn the middle of their territory is the little tribe of the Cabalians,\\nwhich touches the coast near Tauchira, a city of the Barcaeans. Their\\ncustoms are like those of the Libyans above Cyrene. \\n\\nThe Nasamonians, a numerous people, are the western neighbours of\\nthe Auschisae. In summer they leave their flocks and herds upon the\\nsea-shore, and go up the country to a place called Augila, where they\\ngather the dates from the palms, which in those parts grow thickly,\\nand are of great size, all of them being of the fruit-bearing kind.\\nThey also chase the locusts, and, when caught, dry them in the sun,\\nafter which they grind them to powder, and, sprinkling this upon their\\nmilk, so drink it. Each man among them has several wives, in their\\nintercourse with whom they resemble the Massagetae. The following\\nare their customs in the swearing of oaths and the practice of augury.\\nThe man, as he swears, lays his hand upon the tomb of some one considered\\nto have been pre-eminently just and good, and so doing swears by his\\nname. For divination they betake themselves to the sepulchres of their\\nown ancestors, and, after praying, lie down to sleep upon their graves;\\nby the dreams which then come to them they guide their conduct. When\\nthey pledge their faith to one another, each gives the other to drink\\nout of his hand; if there be no liquid to be had, they take up dust\\nfrom the ground, and put their tongues to it. \\n\\nOn the country of the Nasamonians borders that of the Psylli, who\\nwere swept away under the following circumstances. The south-wind\\nhad blown for a long time and dried up all the tanks in which their\\nwater was stored. Now the whole region within the Syrtis is utterly\\ndevoid of springs. Accordingly the Psylli took counsel among themselves,\\nand by common consent made war upon the southwind- so at least the\\nLibyans say, I do but repeat their words- they went forth and reached\\nthe desert; but there the south-wind rose and buried them under heaps\\nof sand: whereupon, the Psylli being destroyed, their lands passed\\nto the Nasamonians. \\n\\nAbove the Nasamonians, towards the south, in the district where the\\nwild beasts abound, dwell the Garamantians, who avoid all society\\nor intercourse with their fellow-men, have no weapon of war, and do\\nnot know how to defend themselves. \\n\\nThese border the Nasamonians on the south: westward along the sea-shore\\ntheir neighbours are the Macea, who, by letting the locks about the\\ncrown of their head grow long, while they clip them close everywhere\\nelse, make their hair resemble a crest. In war these people use the\\nskins of ostriches for shields. The river Cinyps rises among them\\nfrom the height called \"the Hill of the Graces,\" and runs from thence\\nthrough their country to the sea. The Hill of the Graces is thickly\\ncovered with wood, and is thus very unlike the rest of Libya, which\\nis bare. It is distant two hundred furlongs from the sea.\\n\\nAdjoining the Macae are the Gindanes, whose women wear on their legs\\nanklets of leather. Each lover that a woman has gives her one; and\\nshe who can show the most is the best esteemed, as she appears to\\nhave been loved by the greatest number of men. \\n\\nA promontory jutting out into the sea from the country of the Gindanes\\nis inhabited by the Lotophagi, who live entirely on the fruit of the\\nlotus-tree. The lotus fruit is about the size of the lentisk berry,\\nand in sweetness resembles the date. The Lotophagi even succeed in\\nobtaining from it a sort of wine. \\n\\nThe sea-coast beyond the Lotophagi is occupied by the Machlyans, who\\nuse the lotus to some extent, though not so much as the people of\\nwhom we last spoke. The Machlyans reach as far as the great river\\ncalled the Triton, which empties itself into the great lake Tritonis.\\nHere, in this lake, is an island called Phla, which it is said the\\nLacedaemonians were to have colonised, according to an oracle.\\n\\nThe following is the story as it is commonly told. When Jason had\\nfinished building the Argo at the foot of Mount Pelion, he took on\\nboard the usual hecatomb, and moreover a brazen tripod. Thus equipped,\\nhe set sail, intending to coast round the Peloponnese, and so to reach\\nDelphi. The voyage was prosperous as far as Malea; but at that point\\na gale of wind from the north came on suddenly, and carried him out\\nof his course to the coast of Libya; where, before he discovered the\\nland, he got among the shallows of Lake Tritonis. As he was turning\\nit in his mind how he should find his way out, Triton (they say) appeared\\nto him, and offered to show him the channel, and secure him a safe\\nretreat, if he would give him the tripod. Jason complying, was shown\\nby Triton the passage through the shallows; after which the god took\\nthe tripod, and, carrying it to his own temple, seated himself upon\\nit, and, filled with prophetic fury, delivered to Jason and his companions\\na long prediction. \"When a descendant,\" he said, \"of one of the Argo\\'s\\ncrew should seize and carry off the brazen tripod, then by inevitable\\nfate would a hundred Grecian cities be built around Lake Tritonis.\"\\nThe Libyans of that region, when they heard the words of this prophecy,\\ntook away the tripod and hid it. \\n\\nThe next tribe beyond the Machlyans is the tribe of the Auseans. Both\\nthese nations inhabit the borders of Lake Tritonis, being separated\\nfrom one another by the river Triton. Both also wear their hair long,\\nbut the Machlyans let it grow at the back of the head, while the Auseans\\nhave it long in front. The Ausean maidens keep year by year a feast\\nin honour of Minerva, whereat their custom is to draw up in two bodies,\\nand fight with stones and clubs. They say that these are rites which\\nhave come down to them from their fathers, and that they honour with\\nthem their native goddess, who is the same as the Minerva (Athene)\\nof the Grecians. If any of the maidens die of the wounds they receive,\\nthe Auseans declare that such are false maidens. Before the fight\\nis suffered to begin, they have another ceremony. One of the virgins,\\nthe loveliest of the number, is selected from the rest; a Corinthian\\nhelmet and a complete suit of Greek armour are publicly put upon her;\\nand, thus adorned, she is made to mount into a chariot, and led around\\nthe whole lake in a procession. What arms they used for the adornment\\nof their damsels before the Greeks came to live in their country,\\nI cannot say. I imagine they dressed them in Egyptian armour, for\\nI maintain that both the shield and the helmet came into Greece from\\nEgypt. The Auseans declare that Minerva is the daughter of Neptune\\nand the Lake Tritonis- they say she quarrelled with her father, and\\napplied to Jupiter, who consented to let her be his child; and so\\nshe became his adopted daughter. These people do not marry or live\\nin families, but dwell together like the gregarious beasts. When their\\nchildren are full-grown, they are brought before the assembly of the\\nmen, which is held every third month, and assigned to those whom they\\nmost resemble. \\n\\nSuch are the tribes of wandering Libyans dwelling upon the sea-coast.\\nAbove them inland is the wild-beast tract: and beyond that, a ridge\\nof sand, reaching from Egyptian Thebes to the Pillars of Hercules.\\nThroughout this ridge, at the distance of about ten days\\' journey\\nfrom one another, heaps of salt in large lumps lie upon hills. At\\nthe top of every hill there gushes forth from the middle of the salt\\na stream of water, which is both cold and sweet. Around dwell men\\nwho are the last inhabitants of Libya on the side of the desert, living,\\nas they do, more inland than the wild-beast district. Of these nations\\nthe first is that of the Ammonians, who dwell at a distance of ten\\ndays\\' from Thebes, and have a temple derived from that of the Theban\\nJupiter. For at Thebes likewise, as I mentioned above, the image of\\nJupiter has a face like that of a ram. The Ammonians have another\\nspring besides that which rises from the salt. The water of this stream\\nis lukewarm at early dawn; at the time when the market fills it is\\nmuch cooler; by noon it has grown quite cold; at this time, therefore,\\nthey water their gardens. As the afternoon advances the coldness goes\\noff, till, about sunset, the water is once more lukewarm; still the\\nheat increases, and at midnight it boils furiously. After this time\\nit again begins to cool, and grows less and less hot till morning\\ncomes. This spring is called \"the Fountain of the Sun.\" \\n\\nNext to the Ammonians, at the distance of ten days\\' journey along\\nthe ridge of sand, there is a second salt-hill like the Ammonian,\\nand a second spring. The country round is inhabited, and the place\\nbears the name of Augila. Hither it is that the Nasamonians come to\\ngather in the dates. \\n\\nTen days\\' journey from Augila there is again a salt-hill and a spring;\\npalms of the fruitful kind grow here abundantly, as they do also at\\nthe other salt-hills. This region is inhabited by a nation called\\nthe Garamantians, a very powerful people, who cover the salt with\\nmould, and then sow their crops. From thence is the shortest road\\nto the Lutophagi, a journey of thirty days. In the Garamantian country\\nare found the oxen which, as they graze, walk backwards. This they\\ndo because their horns curve outwards in front of their heads, so\\nthat it is not possible for them when grazing to move forwards, since\\nin that case their horns would become fixed in the ground. Only herein\\ndo they differ from other oxen, and further in the thickness and hardness\\nof their hides. The Garamantians have four-horse chariots, in which\\nthey chase the Troglodyte Ethiopians, who of all the nations whereof\\nany account has reached our ears are by far the swiftest of foot.\\nThe Troglodytes feed on serpents, lizards, and other similar reptiles.\\nTheir language is unlike that of any other people; it sounds like\\nthe screeching of bats. \\n\\nAt the distance of ten days\\' journey from the Garamantians there is\\nagain another salt-hill and spring of water; around which dwell a\\npeople, called the Atarantians, who alone of all known nations are\\ndestitute of names. The title of Atarantians is borne by the whole\\nrace in common; but the men have no particular names of their own.\\nThe Atarantians, when the sun rises high in the heaven, curse him,\\nand load him with reproaches, because (they say) he burns and wastes\\nboth their country and themselves. Once more at the distance of ten\\ndays\\' there is a salt-hill, a spring, and an inhabited tract. Near\\nthe salt is a mountain called Atlas, very taper and round; so lofty,\\nmoreover, that the top (it is said) cannot be seen, the clouds never\\nquitting it either summer or winter. The natives call this mountain\\n\"the Pillar of Heaven\"; and they themselves take their name from it,\\nbeing called Atlantes. They are reported not to eat any living thing,\\nand never to have any dreams. \\n\\nAs far as the Atlantes the names of the nations inhabiting the sandy\\nridge are known to me; but beyond them my knowledge fails. The ridge\\nitself extends as far as the Pillars of Hercules, and even further\\nthan these; and throughout the whole distance, at the end of every\\nten days\\' there is a salt-mine, with people dwelling round it who\\nall of them build their houses with blocks of the salt. No rain falls\\nin these parts of Libya; if it were otherwise, the walls of these\\nhouses could not stand. The salt quarried is of two colours, white\\nand purple. Beyond the ridge, southwards, in the direction of the\\ninterior, the country is a desert, with no springs, no beasts, no\\nrain, no wood, and altogether destitute of moisture. \\n\\nThus from Egypt as far as Lake Tritonis Libya is inhabited by wandering\\ntribes, whose drink is milk and their food the flesh of animals. Cow\\'s\\nflesh, however, none of these tribes ever taste, but abstain from\\nit for the same reason as the Egyptians, neither do they any of them\\nbreed swine. Even at Cyrene, the women think it wrong to eat the flesh\\nof the cow, honouring in this Isis, the Egyptian goddess, whom they\\nworship both with fasts and festivals. The Barcaean women abstain,\\nnot from cow\\'s flesh only, but also from the flesh of swine.\\n\\nWest of Lake Tritonis the Libyans are no longer wanderers, nor do\\nthey practise the same customs as the wandering people, or treat their\\nchildren in the same way. For the wandering Libyans, many of them\\nat any rate, if not all- concerning which I cannot speak with certainty-\\nwhen their children come to the age of four years, burn the veins\\nat the top of their heads with a flock from the fleece of a sheep:\\nothers burn the veins about the temples. This they do to prevent them\\nfrom being plagued in their after lives by a flow of rheum from the\\nhead; and such they declare is the reason why they are so much more\\nhealthy than other men. Certainly the Libyans are the healthiest men\\nthat I know; but whether this is what makes them so, or not, I cannot\\npositively say- the healthiest certainly they are. If when the children\\nare being burnt convulsions come on, there is a remedy of which they\\nhave made discovery. It is to sprinkle goat\\'s water upon the child,\\nwho thus treated, is sure to recover. In all this I only repeat what\\nis said by the Libyans. \\n\\nThe rites which the wandering Libyans use in sacrificing are the following.\\nThey begin with the ear of the victim, which they cut off and throw\\nover their house: this done, they kill the animal by twisting the\\nneck. They sacrifice to the Sun and Moon, but not to any other god.\\nThis worship is common to all the Libyans. The inhabitants of the\\nparts about Lake Tritonis worship in addition Triton, Neptune, and\\nMinerva, the last especially. \\n\\nThe dress wherewith Minerva\\'s statues are adorned, and her Aegis,\\nwere derived by the Greeks from the women of Libya. For, except that\\nthe garments of the Libyan women are of leather, and their fringes\\nmade of leathern thongs instead of serpents, in all else the dress\\nof both is exactly alike. The name too itself shows that the mode\\nof dressing the Pallas-statues came from Libya. For the Libyan women\\nwear over their dress stript of the hair, fringed at their edges,\\nand coloured with vermilion; and from these goat-skins the Greeks\\nget their word Aegis (goat-harness). I think for my part that the\\nloud cries uttered in our sacred rites came also from thence; for\\nthe Libyan women are greatly given to such cries and utter them very\\nsweetly. Likewise the Greeks learnt from the Libyans to yoke four\\nhorses to a chariot. \\n\\nAll the wandering tribes bury their dead according to the fashion\\nof the Greeks, except the Nasamonians. They bury them sitting, and\\nare right careful when the sick man is at the point of giving up the\\nghost, to make him sit and not let him die lying down. The dwellings\\nof these people are made of the stems of the asphodel, and of rushes\\nwattled together. They can be carried from place to place. Such are\\nthe customs of the afore-mentioned tribes. \\n\\nWestward of the river Triton and adjoining upon the Auseans, are other\\nLibyans who till the ground, and live in houses: these people are\\nnamed the Maxyans. They let the hair grow long on the right side of\\ntheir heads, and shave it close on the left; they besmear their bodies\\nwith red paint; and they say that they are descended from the men\\nof Troy. Their country and the remainder of Libya towards the west\\nis far fuller of wild beasts and of wood than the country of the wandering\\npeople. For the eastern side of Libya, where the wanderers dwell,\\nis low and sandy, as far as the river Triton; but westward of that\\nthe land of the husbandmen is very hilly, and abounds with forests\\nand wild beasts. For this is the tract in which the huge serpents\\nare found, and the lions, the elephants, the bears, the aspicks, and\\nthe horned asses. Here too are the dog-faced creatures, and the creatures\\nwithout heads, whom the Libyans declare to have their eyes in their\\nbreasts; and also the wild men, and wild women, and many other far\\nless fabulous beasts. \\n\\nAmong the wanderers are none of these, but quite other animals; as\\nantelopes, gazelles, buffaloes, and asses, not of the horned sort,\\nbut of a kind which does not need to drink; also oryxes, whose horns\\nare used for the curved sides of citherns, and whose size is about\\nthat of the ox; foxes, hyaenas porcupines, wild rams, dictyes, jackals,\\npanthers, boryes, land-crocodiles about three cubits in length, very\\nlike lizards, ostriches, and little snakes, each with a single horn.\\nAll these animals are found here, and likewise those belonging to\\nother countries, except the stag and the wild boar; but neither stag\\nnor wild-boar are found in any part of Libya. There are, however,\\nthree sorts of mice in these parts; the first are called two-footed;\\nthe next, zegeries, which is a Libyan word meaning \"hills\"; and the\\nthird, urchins. Weasels also are found in the Silphium region, much\\nlike the Tartessian. So many, therefore, are the animals belonging\\nto the land of the wandering Libyans, in so far at least as my researches\\nhave been able to reach. \\n\\nNext to the Maxyan Libyans are the Zavecians, whose wives drive their\\nchariots to battle. \\n\\nOn them border the Gyzantians; in whose country a vast deal of honey\\nis made by bees; very much more, however, by the skill of men. The\\npeople all paint themselves red, and eat monkeys, whereof there is\\ninexhaustible store in the hills. \\n\\nOff their coast, as the Carthaginians report, lies an island, by name\\nCyraunis, the length of which is two hundred furlongs, its breadth\\nnot great, and which is soon reached from the mainland. Vines and\\nolive trees cover the whole of it, and there is in the island a lake,\\nfrom which the young maidens of the country draw up gold-dust, by\\ndipping into the mud birds\\' feathers smeared with pitch. If this be\\ntrue, I know not; I but write what is said. It may be even so, however;\\nsince I myself have seen pitch drawn up out of the water from a lake\\nin Zacynthus. At the place I speak of there are a number of lakes;\\nbut one is larger than the rest, being seventy feet every way, and\\ntwo fathoms in depth. Here they let down a pole into the water, with\\na bunch of myrtle tied to one end, and when they raise it again, there\\nis pitch sticking to the myrtle, which in smell is like to bitumen,\\nbut in all else is better than the pitch of Pieria. This they pour\\ninto a trench dug by the lake\\'s side; and when a good deal has thus\\nbeen got together, they draw it off and put it up in jars. Whatever\\nfalls into the lake passes underground, and comes up in the sea, which\\nis no less than four furlongs distant. So then what is said of the\\nisland off the Libyan coast is not without likelihood. \\n\\nThe Carthaginians also relate the following:- There is a country in\\nLibya, and a nation, beyond the Pillars of Hercules, which they are\\nwont to visit, where they no sooner arrive but forthwith they unlade\\ntheir wares, and, having disposed them after an orderly fashion along\\nthe beach, leave them, and, returning aboard their ships, raise a\\ngreat smoke. The natives, when they see the smoke, come down to the\\nshore, and, laying out to view so much gold as they think the worth\\nof the wares, withdraw to a distance. The Carthaginians upon this\\ncome ashore and look. If they think the gold enough, they take it\\nand go their way; but if it does not seem to them sufficient, they\\ngo aboard ship once more, and wait patiently. Then the others approach\\nand add to their gold, till the Carthaginians are content. Neither\\nparty deals unfairly by the other: for they themselves never touch\\nthe gold till it comes up to the worth of their goods, nor do the\\nnatives ever carry off the goods till the gold is taken away.\\n\\nThese be the Libyan tribes whereof I am able to give the names; and\\nmost of these cared little then, and indeed care little now, for the\\nking of the Medes. One thing more also I can add concerning this region,\\nnamely, that, so far as our knowledge reaches, four nations, and no\\nmore, inhabit it; and two of these nations are indigenous, while two\\nare not. The two indigenous are the Libyans and Ethiopians, who dwell\\nrespectively in the north and the south of Libya. The Phoenicians\\nand the Greek are in-comers. \\n\\nIt seems to me that Libya is not to compare for goodness of soil with\\neither Asia or Europe, except the Cinyps region, which is named after\\nthe river that waters it. This piece of land is equal to any country\\nin the world for cereal crops, and is in nothing like the rest of\\nLibya. For the soil here is black, and springs of water abound; so\\nthat there is nothing to fear from drought; nor do heavy rains (and\\nit rains in that part of Libya) do any harm when they soak the ground.\\nThe returns of the harvest come up to the measure which prevails in\\nBabylonia. The soil is likewise good in the country of the Euesperites;\\nfor there the land brings forth in the best years a hundred-fold.\\nBut the Cinyps region yields three hundred-fold. \\n\\nThe country of the Cyrenaeans, which is the highest tract within the\\npart of Libya inhabited by the wandering tribes, has three seasons\\nthat deserve remark. First the crops along the sea-coast begin to\\nripen, and are ready for the harvest and the vintage; after they have\\nbeen gathered in, the crops of the middle tract above the coast region\\n(the hill-country, as they call it) need harvesting; while about the\\ntime when this middle crop is housed, the fruits ripen and are fit\\nfor cutting in the highest tract of all. So that the produce of the\\nfirst tract has been all eaten and drunk by the time that the last\\nharvest comes in. And the harvest-time of the Cyrenaeans continues\\nthus for eight full months. So much concerning these matters.\\n\\nWhen the Persians sent from Egypt by Aryandes to help Pheretima reached\\nBarca, they laid siege to the town, calling on those within to give\\nup the men who had been guilty of the murder of Arcesilaus. The townspeople,\\nhowever, as they had one and all taken part in the deed, refused to\\nentertain the proposition. So the Persians beleaguered Barca for nine\\nmonths, in the course of which they dug several mines from their own\\nlines to the walls, and likewise made a number of vigorous assaults.\\nBut their mines were discovered by a man who was a worker in brass,\\nwho went with a brazen shield all round the fortress, and laid it\\non the ground inside the city. In other Places the shield, when he\\nlaid it down, was quite dumb; but where the ground was undermined,\\nthere the brass of the shield rang. Here, therefore, the Barcaeans\\ncountermined, and slew the Persian diggers. Such was the way in which\\nthe mines were discovered; as for the assaults, the Barcaeans beat\\nthem back. \\n\\nWhen much time had been consumed, and great numbers had fallen on\\nboth sides, nor had the Persians lost fewer than their adversaries,\\nAmasis, the leader of the land-army, perceiving that, although the\\nBarcaeans would never be conquered by force, they might be overcome\\nby fraud, contrived as follows One night he dug a wide trench, and\\nlaid light planks of wood across the opening, after which he brought\\nmould and placed it upon the planks, taking care to make the place\\nlevel with the surrounding ground. At dawn of day he summoned the\\nBarcaeans to a parley: and they gladly hearkening, the terms were\\nat length agreed upon. Oaths were interchanged upon the ground over\\nthe hidden trench, and the agreement ran thus- \"So long as the ground\\nbeneath our feet stands firm, the oath shall abide unchanged; the\\npeople of Barca agree to pay a fair sum to the king, and the Persians\\npromise to cause no further trouble to the people of Barca.\" After\\nthe oath, the Barcaeans, relying upon its terms, threw open all their\\ngates, went out themselves beyond the walls, and allowed as many of\\nthe enemy as chose to enter. Then the Persians broke down their secret\\nbridge, and rushed at speed into the town- their reason for breaking\\nthe bridge being that so they might observe what they had sworn; for\\nthey had promised the Barcaeans that the oath should continue \"so\\nlong as the ground whereon they stood was firm.\" When, therefore,\\nthe bridge was once broken down, the oath ceased to hold.\\n\\nSuch of the Barcaeans as were most guilty the Persians gave up to\\nPheretima, who nailed them to crosses all round the walls of the city.\\nShe also cut off the breasts of their wives, and fastened them likewise\\nabout the walls. The remainder of the people she gave as booty to\\nthe Persians, except only the Battiadae and those who had taken no\\npart in the murder, to whom she handed over the possession of the\\ntown. \\n\\nThe Persians now set out on their return home, carrying with them\\nthe rest of the Barcaeans, whom they had made their slaves. On their\\nway they came to Cyrene; and the Cyrenaeans, out of regard for an\\noracle, let them pass through the town. During the passage, Bares,\\nthe commander of the fleet, advised to seize the place; but Amasis,\\nthe leader of the land-force, would not consent; \"because,\" he said,\\n\"they had only been charged to attack the one Greek city of Barca.\"\\nWhen, however, they had passed through the town, and were encamped\\nupon the hill of Lycaean Jove, it repented them that they had not\\nseized Cyrene, and they endeavoured to enter it a second time. The\\nCyrenaeans, however, would not suffer this; whereupon, though no one\\nappeared to offer them battle, yet a panic came upon the Persians,\\nand they ran a distance of full sixty furlongs before they pitched\\ntheir camp. Here as they lay, a messenger came to them from Aryandes,\\nordering them home. Then the Persians besought the men of Cyrene to\\ngive them provisions for the way, and, these consenting, they set\\noff on their return to Egypt. But the Libyans now beset them, and,\\nfor the sake of their clothes and harness, slew all who dropped behind\\nand straggled, during the whole march homewards. \\n\\nThe furthest point of Libya reached by this Persian host was the city\\nof Euesperides. The Barcaeans carried into slavery were sent from\\nEgypt to the king; and Darius assigned them a village in Bactria for\\ntheir dwelling-place. To this village they gave the name of Barca,\\nand it was to my time an inhabited place in Bactria. \\n\\nNor did Pheretima herself end her days happily. For on her return\\nto Egypt from Libya, directly after taking vengeance on the people\\nof Barca, she was overtaken by a most horrid death. Her body swarmed\\nwith worms, which ate her flesh while she was still alive. Thus do\\nmen, by over-harsh punishments, draw down upon themselves the anger\\nof the gods. Such then, and so fierce, was the vengeance which Pheretima,\\ndaughter of Battus, took upon the Barcaeans. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK V\\n\\nTerpsichore \\n\\nThe Persians left behind by King Darius in Europe, who had Megabazus\\nfor their general, reduced, before any other Hellespontine state,\\nthe people of Perinthus, who had no mind to become subjects of the\\nking. Now the Perinthians had ere this been roughly handled by another\\nnation, the Paeonians. For the Paeonians from about the Strymon were\\nonce bidden by an oracle to make war upon the Perinthians, and if\\nthese latter, when the camps faced one another, challenged them by\\nname to fight, then to venture on a battle, but if otherwise, not\\nto make the hazard. The Paeonians followed the advice. Now the men\\nof Perinthus drew out to meet them in the skirts of their city; and\\na threefold single combat was fought on challenge given. Man to man,\\nand horse to horse, and dog to dog, was the strife waged; and the\\nPerinthians, winners of two combats out of the three, in their joy\\nhad raised the paean; when the Paeonians struck by the thought that\\nthis was what the oracle had meant, passed the word one to another,\\nsaying, \"Now of a surety has the oracle been fulfilled for us; now\\nour work begins.\" Then the Paeonians set upon the Perinthians in the\\nmidst of their paean, and defeated them utterly, leaving but few of\\nthem alive. \\n\\nSuch was the affair of the Paeonians, which happened a long time previously.\\nAt this time the Perinthians, after a brave struggle for freedom,\\nwere overcome by numbers, and yielded to Megabazus and his Persians.\\nAfter Perinthus had been brought under, Megabazus led his host through\\nThrace, subduing to the dominion of the king all the towns and all\\nthe nations of those parts. For the king\\'s command to him was that\\nhe should conquer Thrace. \\n\\nThe Thracians are the most powerful people in the world, except, of\\ncourse, the Indians; and if they had one head, or were agreed among\\nthemselves, it is my belief that their match could not be found anywhere,\\nand that they would very far surpass all other nations. But such union\\nis impossible for them, and there are no means of ever bringing it\\nabout. Herein therefore consists their weakness. The Thracians bear\\nmany names in the different regions of their country, but all of them\\nhave like usages in every respect, excepting only the Getae, the Trausi,\\nand those who dwell above the people of Creston. \\n\\nNow the manners and customs of the Getae, who believe in their immortality,\\nI have already spoken of. The Trausi in all else resemble the other\\nThracians, but have customs at births and deaths which I will now\\ndescribe. When a child is born all its kindred sit round about it\\nin a circle and weep for the woes it will have to undergo now that\\nit is come into the world, making mention of every ill that falls\\nto the lot of humankind; when, on the other hand, a man has died,\\nthey bury him with laughter and rejoicings, and say that now he is\\nfree from a host of sufferings, and enjoys the completest happiness.\\n\\nThe Thracians who live above the Crestonaeans observe the following\\ncustoms. Each man among them has several wives; and no sooner does\\na man die than a sharp contest ensues among the wives upon the question\\nwhich of them all the husband loved most tenderly; the friends of\\neach eagerly plead on her behalf, and she to whom the honour is adjudged,\\nafter receiving the praises both of men and women, is slain over the\\ngrave by the hand of her next of kin, and then buried with her husband.\\nThe others are sorely grieved, for nothing is considered such a disgrace.\\n\\nThe Thracians who do not belong to these tribes have the customs which\\nfollow. They sell their children to traders. On their maidens they\\nkeep no watch, but leave them altogether free, while on the conduct\\nof their wives they keep a most strict watch. Brides are purchased\\nof their parents for large sums of money. Tattooing among them marks\\nnoble birth, and the want of it low birth. To be idle is accounted\\nthe most honourable thing, and to be a tiller of the ground the most\\ndishonourable. To live by war and plunder is of all things the most\\nglorious. These are the most remarkable of their customs.\\n\\nThe gods which they worship are but three, Mars, Bacchus, and Dian.\\nTheir kings, however, unlike the rest of the citizens, worship Mercury\\nmore than any other god, always swearing by his name, and declaring\\nthat they are themselves sprung from him. \\n\\nTheir wealthy ones are buried in the following fashion. The body is\\nlaid out for three days; and during this time they kill victims of\\nall kinds, and feast upon them, after first bewailing the departed.\\nThen they either burn the body or else bury it in the ground. Lastly,\\nthey raise a mound over the grave, and hold games of all sorts, wherein\\nthe single combat is awarded the highest prize. Such is the mode of\\nburial among the Thracians. \\n\\nAs regards the region lying north of this country no one can say with\\nany certainty what men inhabit it. It appears that you no sooner cross\\nthe Ister than you enter on an interminable wilderness. The only people\\nof whom I can hear as dwelling beyond the Ister are the race named\\nSigynnae, who wear, they say, a dress like the Medes, and have horses\\nwhich are covered entirely with a coat of shaggy hair, five fingers\\nin length. They are a small breed, flat-nosed, and not strong enough\\nto bear men on their backs; but when yoked to chariots, they are among\\nthe swiftest known, which is the reason why the people of that country\\nuse chariots. Their borders reach down almost to the Eneti upon the\\nAdriatic Sea, and they call themselves colonists of the Medes; but\\nhow they can be colonists of the Medes I for my part cannot imagine.\\nStill nothing is impossible in the long lapse of ages. Sigynnae is\\nthe name which the Ligurians who dwell above Massilia give to traders,\\nwhile among the Cyprians the word means spears. \\n\\nAccording to the account which the Thracians give, the country beyond\\nthe Ister is possessed by bees, on account of which it is impossible\\nto penetrate farther. But in this they seem to me to say what has\\nno likelihood; for it is certain that those creatures are very impatient\\nof cold. I rather believe that it is on account of the cold that the\\nregions which lie under the Bear are without inhabitants. Such then\\nare the accounts given of this country, the sea-coast whereof Megabazus\\nwas now employed in subjecting to the Persians. \\n\\nKing Darius had no sooner crossed the Hellespont and reached Sardis,\\nthan he bethought himself of the good deed of Histiaeus the Milesian,\\nand the good counsel of the Mytilenean Coes. He therefore sent for\\nboth of them to Sardis, and bade them each crave a boon at his hands.\\nNow Histiaeus, as he was already king of Miletus, did not make request\\nfor any government besides, but asked Darius to give him Myrcinus\\nof the Edonians, where he wished to build him a city. Such was the\\nchoice that Histiaeus made. Coes, on the other hand, as he was a mere\\nburgher, and not a king, requested the sovereignty of Mytilene. Both\\nalike obtained their requests, and straight-way betook themselves\\nto the places which they had chosen. \\n\\nIt chanced in the meantime that King Darius saw a sight which determined\\nhim to bid Megabazus remove the Paeonians from their seats in Europe\\nand transport them to Asia. There were two Paeonians, Pigres and Mantyes,\\nwhose ambition it was to obtain the sovereignty over their countrymen.\\nAs soon therefore as ever Darius crossed into Asia, these men came\\nto Sardis, and brought with them their sister, who was a tall and\\nbeautiful woman. Having so done, they waited till a day came when\\nthe king sat in state in the suburb of the Lydians; and then dressing\\ntheir sister in the richest gear they could, sent her to draw water\\nfor them. She bore a pitcher upon her head, and with one arm led a\\nhorse, while all the way as she went she span flax. Now as she passed\\nby where the king was, Darius took notice of her; for it was neither\\nlike the Persians nor the Lydians, nor any of the dwellers in Asia,\\nto do as she did. Darius accordingly noted her, and ordered some of\\nhis guard to follow her steps, and watch to see what she would do\\nwith the horse. So the spearmen went; and the woman, when she came\\nto the river, first watered the horse, and then filling the pitcher,\\ncame back the same way she had gone, with the pitcher of water upon\\nher head, and the horse dragging upon her arm, while she still kept\\ntwirling the spindle. \\n\\nKing Darius was full of wonder both at what they who had watched the\\nwoman told him, and at what he had himself seen. So he commanded that\\nshe should be brought before him. And the woman came; and with her\\nappeared her brothers, who had been watching everything a little way\\noff. Then Darius asked them of what nation the woman was; and the\\nyoung men replied that they were Paeonians, and she was their sister.\\nDarius rejoined by asking, \"Who the Paeonians were, and in what part\\nof the world they lived? and, further, what business had brought the\\nyoung men to Sardis?\" Then the brothers told him they had come to\\nput themselves under his power, and Paeonia was a country upon the\\nriver Strymon, and the Strymon was at no great distance from the Hellespont.\\nThe Paeonians, they said, were colonists of the Teucrians from Troy.\\nWhen they had thus answered his questions, Darius asked if all the\\nwomen of their country worked so hard? Then the brothers eagerly answered,\\nYes; for this was the very object with which the whole thing had been\\ndone. \\n\\nSo Darius wrote letters to Megabazus, the commander whom he had left\\nbehind in Thrace, and ordered him to remove the Paeonians from their\\nown land, and bring them into his presence, men, women, and children.\\nAnd straightway a horseman took the message, and rode at speed to\\nthe Hellespont; and, crossing it, gave the paper to Megabazus. Then\\nMegabazus, as soon as he had read it, and procured guides from Thrace,\\nmade war upon Paeonia. \\n\\nNow when the Paeonians heard that the Persians were marching against\\nthem, they gathered themselves together, and marched down to the sea-coast,\\nsince they thought the Persians would endeavour to enter their country\\non that side. Here then they stood in readiness to oppose the army\\nof Megabazus. But the Persians, who knew that they had collected,\\nand were gone to keep guard at the pass near the sea, got guides,\\nand taking the inland route before the Paeonians were aware, poured\\ndown upon their cities, from which the men had all marched out; and\\nfinding them empty, easily got possession of them. Then the men, when\\nthey heard that all their towns were taken, scattered this way and\\nthat to their homes, and gave themselves up to the Persians. And so\\nthese tribes of the Paeonians, to wit, the Siropaeonians, the Paeoplians\\nand all the others as far as Lake Prasias, were torn from their seats\\nand led away into Asia. \\n\\nThey on the other hand who dwelt about Mount Pangaeum and in the country\\nof the Doberes, the Agrianians, and the Odomantians, and they likewise\\nwho inhabited Lake Prasias, were not conquered by Megabazus. He sought\\nindeed to subdue the dwellers upon the lake, but could not effect\\nhis purpose. Their manner of living is the following. Platforms supported\\nupon tall piles stand in the middle of the lake, which are approached\\nfrom the land by a single narrow bridge. At the first the piles which\\nbear up the platforms were fixed in their places by the whole body\\nof the citizens, but since that time the custom which has prevailed\\nabout fixing them is this:- they are brought from a hill called Orbelus,\\nand every man drives in three for each wife that he marries. Now the\\nmen have all many wives apiece; and this is the way in which they\\nlive. Each has his own hut, wherein he dwells, upon one of the platforms,\\nand each has also a trapdoor giving access to the lake beneath; and\\ntheir wont is to tie their baby children by the foot with a string,\\nto save them from rolling into the water. They feed their horses and\\ntheir other beasts upon fish, which abound in the lake to such a degree\\nthat a man has only to open his trap-door and to let down a basket\\nby a rope into the water, and then to wait a very short time, when\\nhe draws it up quite full of them. The fish are of two kinds, which\\nthey call the paprax and the tilon. \\n\\nThe Paeonians therefore- at least such of them as had been conquered-\\nwere led away into Asia. As for Megabazus, he no sooner brought the\\nPaeonians under, than he sent into Macedonia an embassy of Persians,\\nchoosing for the purpose the seven men of most note in all the army\\nafter himself. These persons were to go to Amyntas, and require him\\nto give earth and water to King Darius. Now there is a very short\\ncut from the Lake Prasias across to Macedonia. Quite close to the\\nlake is the mine which yielded afterwards a talent of silver a day\\nto Alexander; and from this mine you have only to cross the mountain\\ncalled Dysorum to find yourself in the Macedonian territory.\\n\\nSo the Persians sent upon this errand, when they reached the court,\\nand were brought into the presence of Amyntas, required him to give\\nearth and water to King Darius. And Amyntas not only gave them what\\nthey asked, but also invited them to come and feast with him; after\\nwhich he made ready the board with great magnificence, and entertained\\nthe Persians in right friendly fashion. Now when the meal was over,\\nand they were all set to the drinking, the Persians said-\\n\\n\"Dear Macedonian, we Persians have a custom when we make a great feast\\nto bring with us to the board our wives and concubines, and make them\\nsit beside us. Now then, as thou hast received us so kindly, and feasted\\nus so handsomely, and givest moreover earth and water to King Darius,\\ndo also after our custom in this matter.\" \\n\\nThen Amyntas answered- \"O, Persians! we have no such custom as this;\\nbut with us men and women are kept apart. Nevertheless, since you,\\nwho are our lords, wish it, this also shall be granted to you.\"\\n\\nWhen Amyntas had thus spoken, he bade some go and fetch the women.\\nAnd the women came at his call and took their seats in a row over\\nagainst the Persians. Then, when the Persians saw that the women were\\nfair and comely, they spoke again to Amyntas and said, that \"what\\nhad been done was not wise; for it had been better for the women not\\nto have come at all, than to come in this way, and not sit by their\\nsides, but remain over against them, the torment of their eyes.\" So\\nAmyntas was forced to bid the women sit side by side with the Persians.\\nThe women did as he ordered; and then the Persians, who had drunk\\nmore than they ought, began to put their hands on them, and one even\\ntried to give the woman next him a kiss. \\n\\nKing Amyntas saw, but he kept silence, although sorely grieved, for\\nhe greatly feared the power of the Persians. Alexander, however, Amyntas\\'\\nson, who was likewise there and witnessed the whole, being a young\\nman and unacquainted with suffering, could not any longer restrain\\nhimself. He therefore, full of wrath, spake thus to Amyntas:- \"Dear\\nfather, thou art old and shouldst spare thyself. Rise up from table\\nand go take thy rest; do not stay out the drinking. I will remain\\nwith the guests and give them all that is fitting.\" \\n\\nAmyntas, who guessed that Alexander would play some wild prank, made\\nanswer:- \"Dear son, thy words sound to me as those of one who is well\\nnigh on fire, and I perceive thou sendest me away that thou mayest\\ndo some wild deed. I beseech thee make no commotion about these men,\\nlest thou bring us all to ruin, but bear to look calmly on what they\\ndo. For myself, I will e\\'en withdraw as thou biddest me.\"\\n\\nAmyntas, when he had thus besought his son, went out; and Alexander\\nsaid to the Persians, \"Look on these ladies as your own, dear strangers,\\nall or any of them- only tell us your wishes. But now, as the evening\\nwears, and I see you have all had wine enough, let them, if you please,\\nretire, and when they have bathed they shall come back again.\" To\\nthis the Persians agreed, and Alexander, having got the women away,\\nsent them off to the harem, and made ready in their room an equal\\nnumber of beardless youths, whom he dressed in the garments of the\\nwomen, and then, arming them with daggers, brought them in to the\\nPersians, saying as he introduced them, \"Methinks, dear Persians,\\nthat your entertainment has fallen short in nothing. We have set before\\nyou all that we had ourselves in store, and all that we could anywhere\\nfind to give you- and now, to crown the whole, we make over to you\\nour sisters and our mothers, that you may perceive yourselves to be\\nentirely honoured by us, even as you deserve to be- and also that\\nyou may take back word to the king who sent you here, that there was\\none man, a Greek, the satrap of Macedonia, by whom you were both feasted\\nand lodged handsomely.\" So speaking, Alexander set by the side of\\neach Persian one of those whom he had called Macedonian women, but\\nwho were in truth men. And these men, when the Persians began to be\\nrude, despatched them with their daggers. \\n\\nSo the ambassadors perished by this death, both they and also their\\nfollowers. For the Persians had brought a great train with them, carriages,\\nand attendants, and baggage of every kind- all of which disappeared\\nat the same time as the men themselves. Not very long afterwards the\\nPersians made strict search for their lost embassy; but Alexander,\\nwith much wisdom, hushed up the business, bribing those sent on the\\nerrand, partly with money, and partly with the gift of his own sister\\nGygaea, whom he gave in marriage to Bubares, a Persian, the chief\\nleader of the expedition which came in search of the lost men. Thus\\nthe death of these Persians was hushed up, and no more was said of\\nit. \\n\\nNow that the men of this family are Greeks, sprung from Perdiccas,\\nas they themselves affirm, is a thing which I can declare of my own\\nknowledge, and which I will hereafter make plainly evident. That they\\nare so has been already adjudged by those who manage the Pan-Hellenic\\ncontest at Olympia. For when Alexander wished to contend in the games,\\nand had come to Olympia with no other view, the Greeks who were about\\nto run against him would have excluded him from the contest- saying\\nthat Greeks only were allowed to contend, and not barbarians. But\\nAlexander proved himself to be an Argive, and was distinctly adjudged\\na Greek; after which he entered the lists for the foot-race, and was\\ndrawn to run in the first pair. Thus was this matter settled.\\n\\nMegabazus, having reached the Hellespont with the Paeonians, crossed\\nit, and went up to Sardis. He had become aware while in Europe that\\nHistiaeus the Milesian was raising a wall at Myrcinus- the town upon\\nthe Strymon which he had obtained from King Darius as his guerdon\\nfor keeping the bridge. No sooner therefore did he reach Sardis with\\nthe Paeonians than he said to Darius, \"What mad thing is this that\\nthou hast done, sire, to let a Greek, a wise man and a shrewd, get\\nhold of a town in Thrace, a place too where there is abundance of\\ntimber fit for shipbuilding, and oars in plenty, and mines of silver,\\nand about which are many dwellers both Greek and barbarian, ready\\nenough to take him for their chief, and by day and night to do his\\nbidding! I pray thee make this man cease his work, if thou wouldest\\nnot be entangled in a war with thine own followers. Stop him, but\\nwith a gentle message, only bidding him to come to thee. Then when\\nthou once hast him in thy power, be sure thou take good care that\\nhe never get back to Greece again.\" \\n\\nWith these words Megabazus easily persuaded Darius, who thought he\\nhad shown true foresight in this matter. Darius therefore sent a messenger\\nto Myrcinus, who said, \"These be the words of the king to thee, O\\nHistiaeus! I have looked to find a man well affectioned towards me\\nand towards my greatness; and I have found none whom I can trust like\\nthee. Thy deeds, and not thy words only, have proved thy love for\\nme. Now then, since I have a mighty enterprise in hand, I pray thee\\ncome to me, that I may show thee what I purpose!\" \\n\\nHistiaeus, when he heard this, put faith in the words of the messenger;\\nand, as it seemed to him a grand thing to be the king\\'s counsellor,\\nhe straightway went up to Sardis. Then Darius, when he was come, said\\nto him, \"Dear Histiaeus, hear why I have sent for thee. No sooner\\ndid I return from Scythia, and lose thee out of my sight, than I longed,\\nas I have never longed for aught else, to behold thee once more, and\\nto interchange speech with thee. Right sure I am there is nothing\\nin all the world so precious as a friend who is at once wise and true:\\nboth which thou art, as I have had good proof in what thou hast already\\ndone for me. Now then \\'tis well thou art come; for look, I have an\\noffer to make to thee. Let go Miletus and thy newly-founded town in\\nThrace, and come with me up to Susa; share all that I have; live with\\nme, and be my counsellor. \\n\\nWhen Darius had thus spoken he made Artaphernes, his brother by the\\nfather\\'s side, governor of Sardis, and taking Histiaeus with him,\\nwent up to Susa. He left as general of all the troops upon the sea-coast\\nOtanes, son of Sisamnes, whose father King Cambyses slew and flayed,\\nbecause that he, being of the number of the royal judges, had taken\\nmoney to give an unrighteous sentence. Therefore Cambyses slew and\\nflayed Sisamnes, and cutting his skin into strips, stretched them\\nacross the seat of the throne whereon he had been wont to sit when\\nhe heard causes. Having so done Cambyses appointed the son of Sisamnes\\nto be judge in his father\\'s room, and bade him never forget in what\\nway his seat was cushioned. \\n\\nAccordingly this Otanes, who had occupied so strange a throne, became\\nthe successor of Megabazus in his command, and took first of all Byzantium\\nand Chalcidon, then Antandrus in the Troas, and next Lamponium. This\\ndone, he borrowed ships of the Lesbians, and took Lemnos and Imbrus,\\nwhich were still inhabited by Pelasgians. \\n\\nNow the Lemnians stood on their defence, and fought gallantly; but\\nthey were brought low in course of time. Such as outlived the struggle\\nwere placed by the Persians under the government of Lycaretus, the\\nbrother of that Maeandrius who was tyrant of Samos. (This Lycaretus\\ndied afterwards in his government.) The cause which Otanes alleged\\nfor conquering and enslaving all these nations was that some had refused\\nto join the king\\'s army against Scythia, while others had molested\\nthe host on its return. Such were the exploits which Otanes performed\\nin his command. \\n\\nAfterwards, but for no long time, there was a respite from suffering.\\nThen from Naxos and Miletus troubles gathered anew about Ionia. Now\\nNaxos at this time surpassed all the other islands in prosperity,\\nand Miletus had reached the height of her power, and was the glory\\nof Ionia. But previously for two generations the Milesians had suffered\\ngrievously from civil disorders, which were composed by the Parians,\\nwhom the Milesians chose before all the rest of the Greeks to rearrange\\ntheir government. \\n\\nNow the way in which the Parians healed their differences was the\\nfollowing. A number of the chief Parians came to Miletus, and when\\nthey saw in how ruined a condition the Milesians were, they said that\\nthey would like first to go over their country. So they went through\\nall Milesia, and on their way, whenever they saw in the waste and\\ndesolate country any land that was well farmed, they took down the\\nnames of the owners in their tablets; and having thus gone through\\nthe whole region, and obtained after all but few names, they called\\nthe people together on their return to Miletus, and made proclamation\\nthat they gave the government into the hands of those persons whose\\nlands they had found well farmed; for they thought it likely (they\\nsaid) that the same persons who had managed their own affairs well\\nwould likewise conduct aright the business of the state. The other\\nMilesians, who in time past had been at variance, they placed under\\nthe rule of these men. Thus was the Milesian government set in order\\nby the Parians. \\n\\nIt was, however, from the two cities above mentioned that troubles\\nbegan now to gather again about Ionia; and this is the way in which\\nthey arose. Certain of the rich men had been banished from Naxos by\\nthe commonalty, and, upon their banishment, had fled to Miletus. Aristagoras,\\nson of Molpagoras, the nephew and likewise the son-in-law of Histiaeus,\\nson of Lysagoras, who was still kept by Darius at Susa, happened to\\nbe regent of Miletus at the time of their coming. For the kingly power\\nbelonged to Histiaeus; but he was at Susa when the Naxians came. Now\\nthese Naxians had in times past been bond-friends of Histiaeus; and\\nso on their arrival at Miletus they addressed themselves to Aristagoras\\nand begged him to lend them such aid as his ability allowed, in hopes\\nthereby to recover their country. Then Aristagoras, considering with\\nhimself that, if the Naxians should be restored by his help, he would\\nbe lord of Naxos, put forward the friendship with Histiaeus to cloak\\nhis views, and spoke as follows:- \\n\\n\"I cannot engage to furnish you with such a power as were needful\\nto force you, against their will, upon the Naxians who hold the city;\\nfor I know they can bring into the field eight thousand bucklers,\\nand have also a vast number of ships of war. But I will do all that\\nlies in my power to get you some aid, and I think I can manage it\\nin this way. Artaphernes happens to be my friend. Now he is a son\\nof Hystaspes, and brother to King Darius. All the sea-coast of Asia\\nis under him, and he has a numerous army and numerous ships. I think\\nI can prevail on him to do what we require.\" \\n\\nWhen the Naxians heard this, they empowered Aristagoras to manage\\nthe matter for them as well as he could, and told him to promise gifts\\nand pay for the soldiers, which (they said) they would readily furnish,\\nsince they had great hope that the Naxians, so soon as they saw them\\nreturned, would render them obedience, and likewise the other islanders.\\nFor at that time not one of the Cyclades was subject to King Darius.\\n\\nSo Aristagoras went to Sardis and told Artaphernes that Naxos was\\nan island of no great size, but a fair land and fertile, lying near\\nIonia, and containing much treasure and a vast number of slaves. \"Make\\nwar then upon this land (he said) and reinstate the exiles; for if\\nthou wilt do this, first of all, I have very rich gifts in store for\\nthee (besides the cost of the armament, which it is fair that we who\\nare the authors of the war should pay); and, secondly, thou wilt bring\\nunder the power of the king not only Naxos but the other islands which\\ndepend on it, as Paros, Andros, and all the rest of the Cyclades.\\nAnd when thou hast gained these, thou mayest easily go on against\\nEuboea, which is a large and wealthy island not less in size than\\nCyprus, and very easy to bring under. A hundred ships were quite enough\\nto subdue the whole.\" The other answered- \"Truly thou art the author\\nof a plan which may much advantage the house of the king, and thy\\ncounsel is good in all points except the number of the ships. Instead\\nof a hundred, two hundred shall be at thy disposal when the spring\\ncomes. But the king himself must first approve the undertaking.\"\\n\\nWhen Aristagoras heard this he was greatly rejoiced, and went home\\nin good heart to Miletus. And Artaphernes, after he had sent a messenger\\nto Susa to lay the plans of Aristagoras before the king, and received\\nhis approval of the undertaking, made ready a fleet of two hundred\\ntriremes and a vast army of Persians and their confederates. The command\\nof these he gave to a Persian named Megabates, who belonged to the\\nhouse of the Achaemenids, being nephew both to himself and to King\\nDarius. It was to a daughter of this man that Pausanias the Lacedaemonian,\\nthe son of Cleombrotus (if at least there be any truth in the tale),\\nwas allianced many years afterwards, when he conceived the desire\\nof becoming tyrant of Greece. Artaphernes now, having named Megabates\\nto the command, sent forward the armament to Aristagoras.\\n\\nMegabates set sail, and, touching at Miletus, took on board Aristagoras\\nwith the Ionian troops and the Naxians; after which he steered, as\\nhe gave out, for the Hellespont; and when he reached Chios, he brought\\nthe fleet to anchor off Caucasa, being minded to wait there for a\\nnorth wind, and then sail straight to Naxos. The Naxians however were\\nnot to perish at this time; and so the following events were brought\\nabout. As Megabates went his rounds to visit the watches on board\\nthe ships, he found a Myndian vessel upon which there was none set.\\nFull of anger at such carelessness, he bade his guards to seek out\\nthe captain, one Scylax by name, and thrusting him through one of\\nthe holes in the ship\\'s side, to fasten him there in such a way that\\nhis head might show outside the vessel, while his body remained within.\\nWhen Scylax was thus fastened, one went and informed Aristagoras that\\nMegabates had bound his Myndian friend and was entreating him shamefully.\\nSo he came and asked Megabates to let the man off; but the Persian\\nrefused him; whereupon Aristagoras went himself and set Scylax free.\\nWhen Megabates heard this he was still more angry than before, and\\nspoke hotly to Aristagoras. Then the latter said to him-\\n\\n\"What has thou to do with these matters? Wert thou not sent here by\\nArtaphernes to obey me, and to sail whithersoever I ordered? Why dost\\nmeddle so? \\n\\nThus spake Aristagoras. The other, in high dudgeon at such language,\\nwaited till the night, and then despatched a boat to Naxos, to warn\\nthe Naxians of the coming danger. \\n\\nNow the Naxians up to this time had not had any suspicion that the\\narmament was directed against them; as soon, therefore, as the message\\nreached them, forthwith they brought within their walls all that they\\nhad in the open field, and made themselves ready against a siege by\\nprovisioning their town both with food and drink. Thus was Naxos placed\\nin a posture of defence; and the Persians, when they crossed the sea\\nfrom Chios, found the Naxians fully prepared for them. However they\\nsat down before the place, and besieged it for four whole months.\\nWhen at length all the stores which they had brought with them were\\nexhausted, and Aristagoras had likewise spent upon the siege no small\\nsum from his private means, and more was still needed to insure success,\\nthe Persians gave up the attempt, and first building certain forts,\\nwherein they left the banished Naxians, withdrew to the mainland,\\nhaving utterly failed in their undertaking. \\n\\nAnd now Aristagoras found himself quite unable to make good his promises\\nto Artaphernes; nay, he was even hard pressed to meet the claims whereto\\nhe was liable for the pay of the troops; and at the same time his\\nfear was great, lest, owing to the failure of the expedition and his\\nown quarrel with Megabates, he should be ousted from the government\\nof Miletus. These manifold alarms had already caused him to contemplate\\nraising a rebellion, when the man with the marked head came from Susa,\\nbringing him instructions on the part of Histiaeus to revolt from\\nthe king. For Histiaeus, when he was anxious to give Aristagoras orders\\nto revolt, could find but one safe way, as the roads were guarded,\\nof making his wishes known; which was by taking the trustiest of his\\nslaves, shaving all the hair from off his head, and then pricking\\nletters upon the skin, and waiting till the hair grew again. Thus\\naccordingly he did; and as soon as ever the hair was grown, he despatched\\nthe man to Miletus, giving him no other message than this- \"When thou\\nart come to Miletus, bid Aristagoras shave thy head, and look thereon.\"\\nNow the marks on the head, as I have already mentioned, were a command\\nto revolt. All this Histiaeus did because it irked him greatly to\\nbe kept at Susa, and because he had strong hopes that, if troubles\\nbroke out, he would be sent down to the coast to quell them, whereas,\\nif Miletus made no movement, he did not see a chance of his ever again\\nreturning thither. \\n\\nSuch, then, were the views which led Histiaeus to despatch his messenger;\\nand it so chanced that all these several motives to revolt were brought\\nto bear upon Aristagoras at one and the same time. \\n\\nAccordingly, at this conjuncture Aristagoras held a council of his\\ntrusty friends, and laid the business before them, telling them both\\nwhat he had himself purposed, and what message had been sent him by\\nHistiaeus. At this council all his friends were of the same way of\\nthinking, and recommended revolt, except only Hecataeus the historian.\\nHe, first of all, advised them by all means to avoid engaging in war\\nwith the king of the Persians, whose might he set forth, and whose\\nsubject nations he enumerated. As however he could not induce them\\nto listen to this counsel, he next advised that they should do all\\nthat lay in their power to make themselves masters of the sea. \"There\\nwas one only way,\" he said, \"so far as he could see, of their succeeding\\nin this. Miletus was, he knew, a weak state- but if the treasures\\nin the temple at Branchidae, which Croesus the Lydian gave to it,\\nwere seized, he had strong hopes that the mastery of the sea might\\nbe thereby gained; at least it would give them money to begin the\\nwar, and would save the treasures from falling into the hands of the\\nenemy.\" Now these treasures were of very great value, as I showed\\nin the first part of my History. The assembly, however, rejected the\\ncounsel of Hecataeus, while, nevertheless, they resolved upon a revolt.\\nOne of their number, it was agreed, should sail to Myus, where the\\nfleet had been lying since its return from Naxos, and endeavour to\\nseize the captains who had gone there with the vessels. \\n\\nIatragoras accordingly was despatched on this errand, and he took\\nwith guile Oliatus the son of Ibanolis the Mylassian, and Histiaeus\\nthe son of Tymnes the Termerean-Coes likewise, the son of Erxander,\\nto whom Darius gave Mytilene, and Aristagoras the son of Heraclides\\nthe Cymaean, and also many others. Thus Aristagoras revolted openly\\nfrom Darius; and now he set to work to scheme against him in every\\npossible way. First of all, in order to induce the Milesians to join\\nheartily in the revolt, he gave out that he laid down his own lordship\\nover Miletus, and in lieu thereof established a commonwealth: after\\nwhich, throughout all Ionia he did the like; for from some of the\\ncities he drove out their tyrants, and to others, whose goodwill he\\nhoped thereby to gain, he handed theirs over, thus giving up all the\\nmen whom he had seized at the Naxian fleet, each to the city whereto\\nhe belonged. \\n\\nNow the Mytileneans had no sooner got Coes into their power, than\\nthey led him forth from the city and stoned him; the Cymaeans, on\\nthe other hand, allowed their tyrant to go free; as likewise did most\\nof the others. And so this form of government ceased throughout all\\nthe cities. Aristagoras the Milesian, after he had in this way put\\ndown the tyrants, and bidden the cities choose themselves captains\\nin their room, sailed away himself on board a trireme to Lacedaemon;\\nfor he had great need of obtaining the aid of some powerful ally.\\n\\nAt Sparta, Anaxandridas the son of Leo was no longer king: he had\\ndied, and his son Cleomenes had mounted the throne, not however by\\nright of merit, but of birth. Anaxandridas took to wife his own sister\\'s\\ndaughter, and was tenderly attached to her; but no children came from\\nthe marriage. Hereupon the Ephors called him before them, and said-\\n\"If thou hast no care for thine own self, nevertheless we cannot allow\\nthis, nor suffer the race of Eurysthenes to die out from among us.\\nCome then, as thy present wife bears thee no children, put her away,\\nand wed another. So wilt thou do what is well-pleasing to the Spartans.\"\\nAnaxandridas however refused to do as they required, and said it was\\nno good advice the Ephors gave, to bid him put away his wife when\\nshe had done no wrong, and take to himself another. He therefore declined\\nto obey them. \\n\\nThen the Ephors and Elders took counsel together, and laid this proposal\\nbefore the king:- \"Since thou art so fond, as we see thee to be, of\\nthy present wife, do what we now advise, and gainsay us not, lest\\nthe Spartans make some unwonted decree concerning thee. We ask thee\\nnot now to put away thy wife to whom thou art married- give her still\\nthe same love and honour as ever- but take thee another wife beside,\\nwho may bear thee children.\" \\n\\nWhen he heard this offer, Anaxandridas gave way- and henceforth he\\nlived with two wives in two separate houses, quite against all Spartan\\ncustom. \\n\\nIn a short time, the wife whom he had last married bore him a son,\\nwho received the name of Cleomenes; and so the heir to the throne\\nwas brought into the world by her. After this, the first wife also,\\nwho in time past had been barren, by some strange chance conceived,\\nand came to be with child. Then the friends of the second wife, when\\nthey heard a rumour of the truth, made a great stir, and said it was\\na false boast, and she meant, they were sure, to bring forward as\\nher own a supposititious child. So they raised an outcry against her;\\nand therefore, when her full time was come, the Ephors, who were themselves\\nincredulous, sat round her bed, and kept a strict watch on the labour.\\nAt this time then she bore Dorieus, and after him, quickly, Leonidas,\\nand after him, again quickly, Cleombrotus. Some even say that Leonidas\\nand Cleombrotus were twins. On the other hand, the second wife, the\\nmother of Cleomenes (who was a daughter of Prinetadas, the son of\\nDemarmenus), never gave birth to a second child. \\n\\nNow Cleomenes, it is said, was not right in his mind; indeed he verged\\nupon madness; while Dorieus surpassed all his co-mates, and looked\\nconfidently to receiving the kingdom on the score of merit. When,\\ntherefore, after the death of Anaxandridas, the Spartans kept to the\\nlaw, and made Cleomenes, his eldest son, king in his room, Dorieus,\\nwho had imagined that he should be chosen, and who could not bear\\nthe thought of having such a man as Cleomenes to rule over him, asked\\nthe Spartans to give him a body of men, and left Sparta with them\\nin order to found a colony. However, he neither took counsel of the\\noracle at Delphi as to the place whereto he should go, nor observed\\nany of the customary usages; but left Sparta in dudgeon, and sailed\\naway to Libya, under the guidance of certain men who were Theraeans.\\nThese men brought him to Cinyps, where he colonised a spot, which\\nhas not its equal in all Libya, on the banks of a river: but from\\nthis place he was driven in the third year by the Macians, the Libyans,\\nand the Carthaginians. \\n\\nDorieus returned to the Peloponnese; whereupon Antichares the Eleonian\\ngave him a counsel (which he got from the oracle of Laius), to \"found\\nthe city of Heraclea in Sicily; the whole country of Eryx belonged,\"\\nhe said, \"to the Heracleids, since Hercules himself conquered it.\"\\nOn receiving this advice, Dorieus went to Delphi to inquire of the\\noracle whether he would take the place to which he was about to go.\\nThe Pythoness prophesied that he would; whereupon Dorieus went back\\nto Libya, took up the men who had sailed with him at the first, and\\nproceeded upon his way along the shores of Italy. \\n\\nJust at this time, the Sybarites say, they and their king Telys were\\nabout to make war upon Crotona, and the Crotoniats, greatly alarmed,\\nbesought Dorieus to lend them aid. Dorieus was prevailed upon, bore\\npart in the war against Sybaris, and had a share in taking the town.\\nSuch is the account which the Sybarites give of what was done by Dorieus\\nand his companions. The Crotoniats, on the other hand, maintain that\\nno foreigner lent them aid in their war against the Sybarites, save\\nand except Callias the Elean, a soothsayer of the race of the Iamidae;\\nand he only forsook Telys the Sybaritic king, and deserted to their\\nside, when he found on sacrificing that the victims were not favourable\\nto an attack on Crotona. Such is the account which each party gives\\nof these matters. \\n\\nBoth parties likewise adduce testimonies to the truth of what they\\nsay. The Sybarites show a temple and sacred precinct near the dry\\nstream of the Crastis, which they declare that Dorieus, after taking\\ntheir city, dedicated to Minerva Crastias. And further, they bring\\nforward the death of Dorieus as the surest proof; since he fell, they\\nsay, because he disobeyed the oracle. For had he in nothing varied\\nfrom the directions given him, but confined himself to the business\\non which he was sent, he would assuredly have conquered the Erycian\\nterritory, and kept possession of it, instead of perishing with all\\nhis followers. The Crotoniats, on the other hand, point to the numerous\\nallotments within their borders which were assigned to Callias the\\nElean by their countrymen, and which to my day remained in the possession\\nof his family; while Dorieus and his descendants (they remark) possess\\nnothing. Yet if Dorieus had really helped them in the Sybaritic war,\\nhe would have received very much more than Callias. Such are the testimonies\\nwhich are adduced on either side; it is open to every man to adopt\\nwhichever view he deems the best. \\n\\nCertain Spartans accompanied Dorieus on his voyage as co-founders,\\nto wit, Thessalus, Paraebates, Celeas, and Euryleon. These men and\\nall the troops under their command reached Sicily; but there they\\nfell in a battle wherein they were defeated by the Egestaeans and\\nPhoenicians, only one, Euryleon, surviving the disaster. He then,\\ncollecting the remnants of the beaten army, made himself master of\\nMinoa, the Selinusian colony, and helped the Selinusians to throw\\noff the yoke of their tyrant Peithagoras. Having upset Peithagoras,\\nhe sought to become tyrant in his room, and he even reigned at Selinus\\nfor a brief space- but after a while the Selinusians rose up in revolt\\nagainst him, and though he fled to the altar of Jupiter Agoraeus,\\nthey notwithstanding put him to death. \\n\\nAnother man who accompanied Dorieus, and died with him, was Philip\\nthe son of Butacidas, a man of Crotona; who, after he had been betrothed\\nto a daughter of Telys the Sybarite, was banished from Crotona, whereupon\\nhis marriage came to nought; and he in his disappointment took ship\\nand sailed to Cyrene. From thence he became a follower of Dorieus,\\nfurnishing to the fleet a trireme of his own, the crew of which he\\nsupported at his own charge. This Philip was an Olympian victor, and\\nthe handsomest Greek of his day. His beauty gained him honours at\\nthe hands of the Egestaeans which they never accorded to any one else;\\nfor they raised a hero-temple over his grave, and they still worship\\nhim with sacrifices. \\n\\nSuch then was the end of Dorieus, who if he had brooked the rule of\\nCleomenes, and remained in Sparta, would have been king of Lacedaemon;\\nsince Cleomenes, after reigning no great length of time, died without\\nmale offspring, leaving behind him an only daughter, by name Gorgo.\\n\\nCleomenes, however, was still king when Aristagoras, tyrant of Miletus,\\nreached Sparta. At their interview, Aristagoras, according to the\\nreport of the Lacedaemonians, produced a bronze tablet, whereupon\\nthe whole circuit of the earth was engraved, with all its seas and\\nrivers. Discourse began between the two; and Aristagoras addressed\\nthe Spartan king in these words following:- \"Think it not strange,\\nO King Cleomenes, that I have been at the pains to sail hither; for\\nthe posture of affairs, which I will now recount unto thee, made it\\nfitting. Shame and grief is it indeed to none so much as to us, that\\nthe sons of the Ionians should have lost their freedom, and come to\\nbe the slaves of others; but yet it touches you likewise, O Spartans,\\nbeyond the rest of the Greeks, inasmuch as the pre-eminence over all\\nGreece appertains to you. We beseech you, therefore, by the common\\ngods of the Grecians, deliver the Ionians, who are your own kinsmen,\\nfrom slavery. Truly the task is not difficult; for the barbarians\\nare an unwarlike people; and you are the best and bravest warriors\\nin the whole world. Their mode of fighting is the following:- they\\nuse bows and arrows and a short spear; they wear trousers in the field,\\nand cover their heads with turbans. So easy are they to vanquish!\\nKnow too that the dwellers in these parts have more good things than\\nall the rest of the world put together- gold, and silver, and brass,\\nand embroidered garments, beasts of burthen, and bond-servants- all\\nwhich, if you only wish it, you may soon have for your own. The nations\\nborder on one another, in the order which I will now explain. Next\\nto these Ionians\" (here he pointed with his finger to the map of the\\nworld which was engraved upon the tablet that he had brought with\\nhim) \"these Lydians dwell; their soil is fertile, and few people are\\nso rich in silver. Next to them,\" he continued, \"come these Phrygians,\\nwho have more flocks and herds than any race that I know, and more\\nplentiful harvests. On them border the Cappadocians, whom we Greeks\\nknow by the name of Syrians: they are neighbours to the Cilicians,\\nwho extend all the way to this sea, where Cyprus (the island which\\nyou see here) lies. The Cilicians pay the king a yearly tribute of\\nfive hundred talents. Next to them come the Armenians, who live here-\\nthey too have numerous flocks and herds. After them come the Matieni,\\ninhabiting this country; then Cissia, this province, where you see\\nthe river Choaspes marked, and likewise the town Susa upon its banks,\\nwhere the Great King holds his court, and where the treasuries are\\nin which his wealth is stored. Once masters of this city, you may\\nbe bold to vie with Jove himself for riches. In the wars which ye\\nwage with your rivals of Messenia, with them of Argos likewise and\\nof Arcadia, about paltry boundaries and strips of land not so remarkably\\ngood, ye contend with those who have no gold, nor silver even, which\\noften give men heart to fight and die. Must ye wage such wars, and\\nwhen ye might so easily be lords of Asia, will ye decide otherwise?\"\\nThus spoke Aristagoras; and Cleomenes replied to him,- \"Milesian stranger,\\nthree days hence I will give thee an answer.\" \\n\\nSo they proceeded no further at that time. When, however, the day\\nappointed for the answer came, and the two once more met, Cleomenes\\nasked Aristagoras, \"how many days\\' journey it was from the sea of\\nthe Ionians to the king\\'s residence?\" Hereupon Aristagoras, who had\\nmanaged the rest so cleverly, and succeeded in deceiving the king,\\ntripped in his speech and blundered; for instead of concealing the\\ntruth, as he ought to have done if he wanted to induce the Spartans\\nto cross into Asia, he said plainly that it was a journey of three\\nmonths. Cleomenes caught at the words, and, preventing Aristagoras\\nfrom finishing what he had begun to say concerning the road, addressed\\nhim thus:- \"Milesian stranger, quit Sparta before sunset. This is\\nno good proposal that thou makest to the Lacedaemonians, to conduct\\nthem a distance of three months\\' journey from the sea.\" When he had\\nthus spoken, Cleomenes went to his home. \\n\\nBut Aristagoras took an olive-bough in his hand, and hastened to the\\nking\\'s house, where he was admitted by reason of his suppliant\\'s pliant\\'s\\nguise. Gorgo, the daughter of Cleomenes, and his only child, a girl\\nof about eight or nine years of age, happened to be there, standing\\nby her father\\'s side. Aristagoras, seeing her, requested Cleomenes\\nto send her out of the room before he began to speak with him; but\\nCleomenes told him to say on, and not mind the child. So Aristagoras\\nbegan with a promise of ten talents if the king would grant him his\\nrequest, and when Cleomenes shook his head, continued to raise his\\noffer till it reached fifty talents; whereupon the child spoke:- \"Father,\"\\nshe said, \"get up and go, or the stranger will certainly corrupt thee.\"\\nThen Cleomenes, pleased at the warning of his child, withdrew and\\nwent into another room. Aristagoras quitted Sparta for good, not being\\nable to discourse any more concerning the road which led up to the\\nking. \\n\\nNow the true account of the road in question is the following:- Royal\\nstations exist along its whole length, and excellent caravanserais;\\nand throughout, it traverses an inhabited tract, and is free from\\ndanger. In Lydia and Phrygia there are twenty stations within a distance\\nOf 94 1/2 parasangs. On leaving Phrygia the Halys has to be crossed;\\nand here are gates through which you must needs pass ere you can traverse\\nthe stream. A strong force guards this post. When you have made the\\npassage, and are come into Cappadocia, 28 stations and 104 parasangs\\nbring you to the borders of Cilicia, where the road passes through\\ntwo sets of gates, at each of which there is a guard posted. Leaving\\nthese behind, you go on through Cilicia, where you find three stations\\nin a distance of 15 1/2 parasangs. The boundary between Cilicia and\\nArmenia is the river Euphrates, which it is necessary to cross in\\nboats. In Armenia the resting-places are 15 in number, and the distance\\nis 56 1/2 parasangs. There is one place where a guard is posted. Four\\nlarge streams intersect this district, all of which have to be crossed\\nby means of boats. The first of these is the Tigris; the second and\\nthe third have both of them the same name, though they are not only\\ndifferent rivers, but do not even run from the same place. For the\\none which I have called the first of the two has its source in Armenia,\\nwhile the other flows afterwards out of the country of the Matienians.\\nThe fourth of the streams is called the Gyndes, and this is the river\\nwhich Cyrus dispersed by digging for it three hundred and sixty channels.\\nLeaving Armenia and entering the Matienian country, you have four\\nstations; these passed you find yourself in Cissia, where eleven stations\\nand 42 1/2 parasangs bring you to another navigable stream, the Choaspes,\\non the banks of which the city of Susa is built. Thus the entire number\\nof the stations is raised to one hundred and eleven; and so many are\\nin fact the resting-places that one finds between Sardis and Susa.\\n\\nIf then the royal road be measured aright, and the parasang equals,\\nas it does, thirty furlongs, the whole distance from Sardis to the\\npalace of Memnon (as it is called), amounting thus to 450 parasangs,\\nwould be 13,500 furlongs. Travelling then at the rate of 150 furlongs\\na day, one will take exactly ninety days to perform the journey.\\n\\nThus when Aristagoras the Milesian told Cleomenes the Lacedaemonian\\nthat it was a three months\\' journey from the sea up to the king, he\\nsaid no more than the truth. The exact distance (if any one desires\\nstill greater accuracy) is somewhat more; for the journey from Ephesus\\nto Sardis must be added to the foregoing account; and this will make\\nthe whole distance between the Greek Sea and Susa (or the city of\\nMemnon, as it is called) 14,040 furlongs; since Ephesus is distant\\nfrom Sardis 540 furlongs. This would add three days to the three months\\'\\njourney. \\n\\nWhen Aristagoras left Sparta he hastened to Athens, which had got\\nquit of its tyrants in the way that I will now describe. After the\\ndeath of Hipparchus (the son of Pisistratus, and brother of the tyrant\\nHippias), who, in spite of the clear warning he had received concerning\\nhis fate in a dream, was slain by Harmodius and Aristogeiton (men\\nboth of the race of the Gephyraeans), the oppression of the Athenians\\ncontinued by the space of four years; and they gained nothing, but\\nwere worse used than before. \\n\\nNow the dream of Hipparchus was the following:- The night before the\\nPanathenaic festival, he thought he saw in his sleep a tall and beautiful\\nman, who stood over him, and read him the following riddle:-\\n\\nBear thou unbearable woes with the all-bearing heart of a lion;\\n\\nNever, be sure, shall wrong-doer escape the reward of wrong-doing.\\nAs soon as day dawned he sent and submitted his dream to the interpreters,\\nafter which he offered the averting sacrifices, and then went and\\nled the procession in which he perished. \\n\\nThe family of the Gephyraeans, to which the murderers of Hipparchus\\nbelonged, according to their own account, came originally from Eretria.\\nMy inquiries, however, have made it clear to me that they are in reality\\nPhoenicians, descendants of those who came with Cadmus into the country\\nnow called Boeotia. Here they received for their portion the district\\nof Tanagra, in which they afterwards dwelt. On their expulsion from\\nthis country by the Boeotians (which happened some time after that\\nof the Cadmeians from the same parts by the Argives) they took refuge\\nat Athens. The Athenians received them among their citizens upon set\\nterms, whereby they were excluded from a number of privileges which\\nare not worth mentioning. \\n\\nNow the Phoenicians who came with Cadmus, and to whom the Gephyraei\\nbelonged, introduced into Greece upon their arrival a great variety\\nof arts, among the rest that of writing, whereof the Greeks till then\\nhad, as I think, been ignorant. And originally they shaped their letters\\nexactly like all the other Phoenicians, but afterwards, in course\\nof time, they changed by degrees their language, and together with\\nit the form likewise of their characters. Now the Greeks who dwelt\\nabout those parts at that time were chiefly the Ionians. The Phoenician\\nletters were accordingly adopted by them, but with some variation\\nin the shape of a few, and so they arrived at the present use, still\\ncalling the letters Phoenician, as justice required, after the name\\nof those who were the first to introduce them into Greece. Paper rolls\\nalso were called from of old \"parchments\" by the Ionians, because\\nformerly when paper was scarce they used, instead, the skins of sheep\\nand goats- on which material many of the barbarians are even now wont\\nto write. \\n\\nI myself saw Cadmeian characters engraved upon some tripods in the\\ntemple of Apollo Ismenias in Boeotian Thebes, most of them shaped\\nlike the Ionian. One of the tripods has the inscription following:-\\n\\nMe did Amphitryon place, from the far Teleboans coming. \\n\\nThis would be about the age of Laius, the son of Labdacus, the son\\nof Polydorus, the son of Cadmus. \\n\\nAnother of the tripods has this legend in the hexameter measure:-\\n\\nI to far-shooting Phoebus was offered by Scaeus the boxer,\\n\\nWhen he had won at the games- a wondrous beautiful offering. This\\nmight be Scaeus, the son of Hippocoon; and the tripod, if dedicated\\nby him, and not by another of the same name, would belong to the time\\nof Oedipus, the son of Laius. \\n\\nThe third tripod has also an inscription in hexameters, which runs\\nthus:- \\n\\nKing Laodamas gave this tripod to far-seeing Phoebus, \\nWhen he was set on the throne- a wondrous beautiful offering. It was\\nin the reign of this Laodamas, the son of Eteocles, that the Cadmeians\\nwere driven by the Argives out of their country, and found a shelter\\nwith the Encheleans. The Gephyraeans at that time remained in the\\ncountry, but afterwards they retired before the Boeotians, and took\\nrefuge at Athens, where they have a number of temples for their separate\\nuse, which the other Athenians are not allowed to enter- among the\\nrest, one of Achaean Ceres, in whose honour they likewise celebrate\\nspecial orgies. \\n\\nHaving thus related the dream which Hipparchus saw, and traced the\\ndescent of the Gephyraeans, the family whereto his murderers belonged,\\nI must proceed with the matter whereof I was intending before to speak;\\nto wit, the way in which the Athenians got quit of their tyrants.\\nUpon the death of Hipparchus, Hippias, who was king, grew harsh towards\\nthe Athenians; and the Alcaeonidae, an Athenian family which had been\\nbanished by the Pisistratidae, joined the other exiles, and endeavoured\\nto procure their own return, and to free Athens, by force. They seized\\nand fortified Leipsydrium above Paeonia, and tried to gain their object\\nby arms; but great disasters befell them, and their purpose remained\\nunaccomplished. They therefore resolved to shrink from no contrivance\\nthat might bring them success; and accordingly they contracted with\\nthe Amphictyons to build the temple which now stands at Delphi, but\\nwhich in those days did not exist. Having done this, they proceeded,\\nbeing men of great wealth and members of an ancient and distinguished\\nfamily, to build the temple much more magnificently than the plan\\nobliged them. Besides other improvements, instead of the coarse stone\\nwhereof by the contract the temple was to have been constructed, they\\nmade the facings of Parian marble. \\n\\nThese same men, if we may believe the Athenians, during their stay\\nat Delphi persuaded the Pythoness by a bribe to tell the Spartans,\\nwhenever any of them came to consult the oracle, either on their own\\nprivate affairs or on the business of the state, that they must free\\nAthens. So the Lacedaemonians, when they found no answer ever returned\\nto them but this, sent at last Anchimolius, the son of Aster- a man\\nof note among their citizens- at the head of an army against Athens,\\nwith orders to drive out the Pisistratidae, albeit they were bound\\nto them by the closest ties of friendship. For they esteemed the things\\nof heaven more highly than the things of men. The troops went by sea\\nand were conveyed in transports. Anchimolius brought them to an anchorage\\nat Phalerum; and there the men disembarked. But the Pisistratidae,\\nwho had previous knowledge of their intentions, had sent to Thessaly,\\nbetween which country and Athens there was an alliance, with a request\\nfor aid. The Thessalians, in reply to their entreaties, sent them\\nby a public vote 1000 horsemen, under the command of their king, Cineas,\\nwho was a Coniaean. When this help came, the Pisistratidae laid their\\nplan accordingly: they cleared the whole plain about Phalerum so as\\nto make it fit for the movements of cavalry, and then charged the\\nenemy\\'s camp with their horse, which fell with such fury upon the\\nLacedaemonians as to kill numbers, among the rest Anchimolius, the\\ngeneral, and to drive the remainder to their ships. Such was the fate\\nof the first army sent from Lacedaemon, and the tomb of Anchimolius\\nmay be seen to this day in Attica; it is at Alopecae (Foxtown), near\\nthe temple of Hercules in Cynosargos. \\n\\nAfterwards, the Lacedaemonians despatched a larger force against Athens,\\nwhich they put under the command of Cleomenes, son of Anaxandridas,\\none of their kings. These troops were not sent by sea, but marched\\nby the mainland. When they were come into Attica, their first encounter\\nwas with the Thessalian horse, which they shortly put to flight, killing\\nabove forty men; the remainder made good their escape, and fled straight\\nto Thessaly. Cleomenes proceeded to the city, and, with the aid of\\nsuch of the Athenians as wished for freedom, besieged the tyrants,\\nwho had shut themselves up in the Pelasgic fortress. \\n\\nAnd now there had been small chance of the Pisistratidae falling into\\nthe hands of the Spartans, who did not even design to sit down before\\nthe place, which had moreover been well provisioned beforehand with\\nstores both of meat and drink,- nay, it is likely that after a few\\ndays\\' blockade the Lacedaemonians would have quitted Attica altogether,\\nand gone back to Sparta- had not an event occurred most unlucky for\\nthe besieged, and most advantageous for the besiegers. The children\\nof the Pisistratidae were made prisoners, as they were being removed\\nout of the country. By this calamity all their plans were deranged,\\nand-as the ransom of their children- they consented to the demands\\nof the Athenians, and agreed within five days\\' time to quit Attica.\\nAccordingly they soon afterwards left the country, and withdrew to\\nSigeum on the Scamander, after reigning thirty-six years over the\\nAthenians. By descent they were Pylians, of the family of the Neleids,\\nto which Codrus and Melanthus likewise belonged, men who in former\\ntimes from foreign settlers became kings of Athens. And hence it was\\nthat Hippocrates came to think of calling his son Pisistratus: he\\nnamed him after the Pisistratus who was a son of Nestor. Such then\\nwas the mode in which the Athenians got quit of their tyrants. What\\nthey did and suffered worthy of note from the time when they gained\\ntheir freedom until the revolt of Ionia from King Darius, and the\\ncoming of Aristagoras to Athens with a request that the Athenians\\nwould lend the Ionians aid, I shall now proceed to relate.\\n\\nThe power of Athens had been great before; but, now that the tyrants\\nwere gone, it became greater than ever. The chief authority was lodged\\nwith two persons, Clisthenes, of the family of the Alcmaeonids, who\\nis said to have been the persuader of the Pythoness, and Isagoras,\\nthe son of Tisander, who belonged to a noble house, but whose pedigree\\nI am not able to trace further. Howbeit his kinsmen offer sacrifice\\nto the Carian Jupiter. These two men strove together for the mastery;\\nand Clisthenes, finding himself the weaker, called to his aid the\\ncommon people. Hereupon, instead of the four tribes among which the\\nAthenians had been divided hitherto, Clisthenes made ten tribes, and\\nparcelled out the Athenians among them. He likewise changed the names\\nof the tribes; for whereas they had till now been called after Geleon,\\nAegicores, Argades, and Hoples, the four sons of Ion, Clisthenes set\\nthese names aside, and called his tribes after certain other heroes,\\nall of whom were native, except Ajax. Ajax was associated because,\\nalthough a foreigner, he was a neighbour and an ally of Athens.\\n\\nMy belief is that in acting thus he did but imitate his maternal grandfather,\\nClisthenes, king of Sicyon. This king, when he was at war with Argos,\\nput an end to the contests of the rhapsodists at Sicyon, because in\\nthe Homeric poems Argos and the Argives were so constantly the theme\\nof song. He likewise conceived the wish to drive Adrastus, the son\\nof Talaus, out of his country, seeing that he was an Argive hero.\\nFor Adrastus had a shrine at Sicyon, which yet stands in the market-place\\nof the town. Clisthenes therefore went to Delphi, and asked the oracle\\nif he might expel Adrastus. To this the Pythoness is reported to have\\nanswered- \"Adrastus is the Sicyonians\\' king, but thou art only a robber.\"\\nSo when the god would not grant his request, he went home and began\\nto think how he might contrive to make Adrastus withdraw of his own\\naccord. After a while he hit upon a plan which he thought would succeed.\\nHe sent envoys to Thebes in Boeotia, and informed the Thebans that\\nhe wished to bring Melanippus, the son of Astacus, to Sicyon. The\\nThebans consenting, Clisthenes carried Melanippus back with him, assigned\\nhim a precinct within the government-house, and built him a shrine\\nthere in the safest and strongest part. The reason for his so doing\\n(which I must not forbear to mention) was because Melanippus was Adrastus\\'\\ngreat enemy, having slain both his brother Mecistes and his son-in-law\\nTydeus. Clisthenes, after assigning the precinct to Melanippus, took\\naway from Adrastus the sacrifices and festivals wherewith he had till\\nthen been honoured, and transferred them to his adversary. Hitherto\\nthe Sicyonians had paid extraordinary honours to Adrastus, because\\nthe country had belonged to Polybus, and Adrastus was Polybus\\' daughter\\'s\\nson; whence it came to pass that Polybus, dying childless, left Adrastus\\nhis kingdom. Besides other ceremonies, it had been their wont to honour\\nAdrastus with tragic choruses, which they assigned to him rather than\\nBacchus, on account of his calamities. Clisthenes now gave the choruses\\nto Bacchus, transferring to Melanippus the rest of the sacred rites.\\n\\nSuch were his doings in the matter of Adrastus. With respect to the\\nDorian tribes, not choosing the Sicyonians to have the same tribes\\nas the Argives, he changed all the old names for new ones; and here\\nhe took special occasion to mock the Sicyonians, for he drew his new\\nnames from the words \"pig,\" and \"ass,\" adding thereto the usual tribe-endings;\\nonly in the case of his own tribe he did nothing of the sort, but\\ngave them a name drawn from his own kingly office. For he called his\\nown tribe the Archelai, or Rulers, while the others he named Hyatae,\\nor Pig-folk, Oneatae, or Assfolk, and Choereatae, or Swine-folk. The\\nSicyonians kept these names, not only during the reign of Clisthenes,\\nbut even after his death, by the space of sixty years: then, however,\\nthey took counsel together, and changed to the well-known names of\\nHyllaeans, Pamphylians, and Dymanatae, taking at the same time, as\\na fourth name, the title of Aegialeans, from Aegialeus the son of\\nAdrastus. \\n\\nThus had Clisthenes the Sicyonian done. The Athenian Clisthenes, who\\nwas grandson by the mother\\'s side of the other, and had been named\\nafter him, resolved, from contempt (as I believe) of the Ionians,\\nthat his tribes should not be the same as theirs; and so followed\\nthe pattern set him by his namesake of Sicyon. Having brought entirely\\nover to his own side the common people of Athens, whom he had before\\ndisdained, he gave all the tribes new names, and made the number greater\\nthan formerly; instead of the four phylarchs he established ten; he\\nlikewise placed ten demes in each of the tribes; and he was, now that\\nthe common people took his part, very much more powerful than his\\nadversaries. \\n\\nIsagoras in his turn lost ground; and therefore, to counter-plot his\\nenemy, he called in Cleomenes the Lacedaemonian, who had already,\\nat the time when he was besieging the Pisistratidae, made a contract\\nof friendship with him. A charge is even brought against Cleomenes\\nthat he was on terms of too great familiarity with Isagoras\\'s wife.\\nAt this time the first thing that he did was to send a herald and\\nrequire that Clisthenes, and a large number of Athenians besides,\\nwhom he called \"The Accursed,\" should leave Athens. This message he\\nsent at the suggestion of Isagoras: for in the affair referred to,\\nthe blood-guiltiness lay on the Alcmaeonidae and their partisans,\\nwhile he and his friends were quite clear of it. \\n\\nThe way in which \"The Accursed\" at Athens got their name, was the\\nfollowing. There was a certain Athenian called Cylon, a victor at\\nthe Olympic Games, who aspired to the sovereignty, and aided by a\\nnumber of his companions, who were of the same age with himself, made\\nan attempt to seize the citadel. But the attack failed; and Cylon\\nbecame a suppliant at the image. Hereupon the Heads of the Naucraries,\\nwho at that time bore rule in Athens, induced the fugitives to remove\\nby a promise to spare their lives. Nevertheless they were all slain;\\nand the blame was laid on the Alcmaeonidae. All this happened before\\nthe time of Pisistratus. \\n\\nWhen the message of Cleomenes arrived, requiring Clisthenes and \"The\\nAccursed\" to quit the city, Clisthenes departed of his own accord.\\nCleomenes, however, notwithstanding his departure, came to Athens,\\nwith a small band of followers; and on his arrival sent into banishment\\nseven hundred Athenian families, which were pointed out to him by\\nIsagoras. Succeeding here, he next endeavoured to dissolve the council,\\nand to put the government into the hands of three hundred of the partisans\\nof that leader. But the council resisted, and refused to obey his\\norders; whereupon Cleomenes, Isagoras, and their followers took possession\\nof the citadel. Here they were attacked by the rest of the Athenians,\\nwho took the side of the council, and were besieged for the space\\nof two days: on the third day they accepted terms, being allowed-\\nat least such of them as were Lacedaemonians- to quit the country.\\nAnd so the word which came to Cleomenes received its fulfilment. For\\nwhen he first went up into the citadel, meaning to seize it, just\\nas he was entering the sanctuary of the goddess, in order to question\\nher, the priestess arose from her throne, before he had passed the\\ndoors, and said- \"Stranger from Lacedaemon, depart hence, and presume\\nnot to enter the holy place- it is not lawful for a Dorian to set\\nfoot there.\" But he answered, \"Oh! woman, I am not a Dorian, but an\\nAchaean.\" Slighting this warning, Cleomenes made his attempt, and\\nso he was forced to retire, together with his Lacedaemonians. The\\nrest were cast into prison by the Athenians, and condemned to die-\\namong them Timasitheus the Delphian, of whose prowess and courage\\nI have great things which I could tell. \\n\\nSo these men died in prison. The Athenians directly afterwards recalled\\nClisthenes, and the seven hundred families which Cleomenes had driven\\nout; and, further, they sent envoys to Sardis, to make an alliance\\nwith the Persians, for they knew that war would follow with Cleomenes\\nand the Lacedaemonians. When the ambassadors reached Sardis and delivered\\ntheir message, Artaphernes, son of Hystaspes, who was at that time\\ngovernor of the Place, inquired of them \"who they were, and in what\\npart of the world they dwelt, that they wanted to become allies of\\nthe Persians?\" The messengers told him; upon which he answered them\\nshortly- that \"if the Athenians chose to give earth and water to King\\nDarius, he would conclude an alliance with them; but if not, they\\nmight go home again.\" After consulting together, the envoys, anxious\\nto form the alliance, accepted the terms; but on their return to Athens,\\nthey fell into deep disgrace on account of their compliance.\\n\\nMeanwhile Cleomenes, who considered himself to have been insulted\\nby the Athenians both in word and deed, was drawing a force together\\nfrom all parts of the Peloponnese, without informing any one of his\\nobject; which was to revenge himself on the Athenians, and to establish\\nIsagoras, who had escaped with him from the citadel, as despot of\\nAthens. Accordingly, with a large army, he invaded the district of\\nEleusis, while the Boeotians, who had concerted measures with him,\\ntook Oenoe and Hysiae, two country towns upon the frontier; and at\\nthe same time the Chalcideans, on another side, plundered divers places\\nin Attica. The Athenians, notwithstanding that danger threatened them\\nfrom every quarter, put off all thought of the Boeotians and Chalcideans\\ntill a future time, and marched against the Peloponnesians, who were\\nat Eleusis. \\n\\nAs the two hosts were about to engage, first of all the Corinthians,\\nbethinking themselves that they were perpetrating a wrong, changed\\ntheir minds, and drew off from the main army. Then Demaratus, son\\nof Ariston, who was himself king of Sparta and joint-leader of the\\nexpedition, and who till now had had no sort of quarrel with Cleomenes,\\nfollowed their example. On account of this rupture between the kings,\\na law was passed at Sparta, forbidding both monarchs to go out together\\nwith the army, as had been the custom hitherto. The law also provided,\\nthat, as one of the kings was to be left behind, one of the Tyndaridae\\nshould also remain at home; whereas hitherto both had accompanied\\nthe expeditions, as auxiliaries. So when the rest of the allies saw\\nthat the Lacedaemonian kings were not of one mind, and that the Corinthian\\ntroops had quitted their post, they likewise drew off and departed.\\n\\nThis was the fourth time that the Dorians had invaded Attica: twice\\nthey came as enemies, and twice they came to do good service to the\\nAthenian people. Their first invasion took place at the period when\\nthey founded Megara, and is rightly placed in the reign of Codrus\\nat Athens; the second and third occasions were when they came from\\nSparta to drive out the Pisistratidae; the fourth was the present\\nattack, when Cleomenes, at the head of a Peloponnesian army, entered\\nat Eleusis. Thus the Dorians had now four times invaded Attica.\\n\\nSo when the Spartan army had broken up from its quarters thus ingloriously,\\nthe Athenians, wishing to revenge themselves, marched first against\\nthe Chalcideans. The Boeotians, however, advancing to the aid of the\\nlatter as far as the Euripus, the Athenians thought it best to attack\\nthem first. A battle was fought accordingly; and the Athenians gained\\na very complete victory, killing a vast number of the enemy, and taking\\nseven hundred of them alive. After this, on the very same day, they\\ncrossed into Euboea, and engaged the Chalcideans with the like success;\\nwhereupon they left four thousand settlers upon the lands of the Hippobotae,-\\nwhich is the name the Chalcideans give to their rich men. All the\\nChalcidean prisoners whom they took were put in irons, and kept for\\na long time in close confinement, as likewise were the Boeotians,\\nuntil the ransom asked for them was paid; and this the Athenians fixed\\nat two minae the man. The chains wherewith they were fettered the\\nAthenians suspended in their citadel; where they were still to be\\nseen in my day, hanging against the wall scorched by the Median flames,\\nopposite the chapel which faces the west. The Athenians made an offering\\nof the tenth part of the ransom-money: and expended it on the brazen\\nchariot drawn by four steeds, which stands on the left hand immediately\\nthat one enters the gateway of the citadel. The inscription runs as\\nfollows:- \\n\\nWhen Chalcis and Boeotia dared her might, \\nAthens subdued their pride in valorous fight; \\nGave bonds for insults; and, the ransom paid, \\nFrom the full tenths these steeds for Pallas made. \\n\\nThus did the Athenians increase in strength. And it is plain enough,\\nnot from this instance only, but from many everywhere, that freedom\\nis an excellent thing since even the Athenians, who, while they continued\\nunder the rule of tyrants, were not a whit more valiant than any of\\ntheir neighbours, no sooner shook off the yoke than they became decidedly\\nthe first of all. These things show that, while undergoing oppression,\\nthey let themselves be beaten, since then they worked for a master;\\nbut so soon as they got their freedom, each man was eager to do the\\nbest he could for himself. So fared it now with the Athenians.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Thebans, who longed to be revenged on the Athenians,\\nhad sent to the oracle, and been told by the Pythoness that of their\\nown strength they would be unable to accomplish their wish: \"they\\nmust lay the matter,\" she said, \"before the many-voiced, and ask the\\naid of those nearest them.\" The messengers, therefore, on their return,\\ncalled a meeting, and laid the answer of the oracle before the people,\\nwho no sooner heard the advice to \"ask the aid of those nearest them\"\\nthan they exclaimed- \"What! are not they who dwell the nearest to\\nus the men of Tanagra, of Coronaea, and Thespiae? Yet these men always\\nfight on our side, and have aided us with a good heart all through\\nthe war. Of what use is it to ask them? But maybe this is not the\\ntrue meaning of the oracle.\" \\n\\nAs they were thus discoursing one with another, a certain man, informed\\nof the debate, cried out-\"Methinks that I understand what course the\\noracle would recommend to us. Asopus, they say, had two daughters,\\nThebe and Egina. The god means that, as these two were sisters, we\\nought to ask the Eginetans to lend us aid.\" As no one was able to\\nhit on any better explanation, the Thebans forthwith sent messengers\\nto Egina, and, according to the advice of the oracle, asked their\\naid, as the people \"nearest to them.\" In answer to this petition the\\nEginetans said that they would give them the Aeacidae for helpers.\\n\\nThe Thebans now, relying on the assistance of the Aeacidae, ventured\\nto renew the war; but they met with so rough a reception, that they\\nresolved to send to the Eginetans again, returning the Aeacidae, and\\nbeseeching them to send some men instead. The Eginetans, who were\\nat that time a most flourishing people, elated with their greatness,\\nand at the same time calling to mind their ancient feud with Athens,\\nagreed to lend the Thebans aid, and forthwith went to war with the\\nAthenians, without even giving them notice by a herald. The attention\\nof these latter being engaged by the struggle with the Boeotians,\\nthe Eginetans in their ships of war made descents upon Attica, plundered\\nPhalerum, and ravaged a vast number of the townships upon the sea-board,\\nwhereby the Athenians suffered very grievous damage. \\n\\nThe ancient feud between the Eginetans and Athenians arose out of\\nthe following circumstances. Once upon a time the land of Epidaurus\\nwould bear no crops; and the Epidaurians sent to consult the oracle\\nof Delphi concerning their affliction. The answer bade them set up\\nthe images of Damia and Auxesia, and promised them better fortune\\nwhen that should be done. \"Shall the images be made of bronze or stone?\"\\nthe Epidaurians asked; but the Pythoness replied, \"Of neither: but\\nlet them be made of the garden olive.\" Then the Epidaurians sent to\\nAthens and asked leave to cut olive wood in Attica, believing the\\nAthenian olives to be the holiest; or, according to others, because\\nthere were no olives at that time anywhere else in all the world but\\nat Athens.\\' The Athenians answered that they would give them leave,\\nbut on condition of their bringing offerings year by year to Minerva\\nPolias and to Erechtheus. The Epidaurians agreed, and having obtained\\nwhat they wanted, made the images of olive wood, and set them up in\\ntheir own country. Henceforth their land bore its crops; and they\\nduly paid the Athenians what had been agreed upon. \\n\\nAnciently, and even down to the time when this took place, the Eginetans\\nwere in all things subject to the Epidaurians, and had to cross over\\nto Epidaurus for the trial of all suits in which they were engaged\\none with another. After this, however, the Eginetans built themselves\\nships, and, growing proud, revolted from the Epidaurians. Having thus\\ncome to be at enmity with them, the Eginetans, who were masters of\\nthe sea, ravaged Epidaurus, and even carried off these very images\\nof Damia and Auxesia, which they set up in their own country, in the\\ninterior, at a place called Oea, about twenty furlongs from their\\ncity. This done, they fixed a worship for the images, which consisted\\nin part of sacrifices, in part of female satiric choruses; while at\\nthe same time they appointed certain men to furnish the choruses,\\nten for each goddess. These choruses did not abuse men, but only the\\nwomen of the country. Holy orgies of a similar kind were in use also\\namong the Epidaurians, and likewise another sort of holy orgies, whereof\\nit is not lawful to speak. \\n\\nAfter the robbery of the images the Epidaurians ceased to make the\\nstipulated payments to the Athenians, wherefore the Athenians sent\\nto Epidaurus to remonstrate. But the Epidaurians proved to them that\\nthey were not guilty of any wrong:-\"While the images continued in\\ntheir country,\" they said, \"they had duly paid the offerings according\\nto the agreement; now that the images had been taken from them, they\\nwere no longer under any obligation to pay: the Athenians should make\\ntheir demand of the Eginetans, in whose possession the figures now\\nwere.\" Upon this the Athenians sent to Egina, and demanded the images\\nback; but the Eginetans answered that the Athenians had nothing whatever\\nto do with them. \\n\\nAfter this the Athenians relate that they sent a trireme to Egina\\nwith certain citizens on board, and that these men, who bore commission\\nfrom the state, landed in Egina, and sought to take the images away,\\nconsidering them to be their own, inasmuch as they were made of their\\nwood. And first they endeavoured to wrench them from their pedestals,\\nand so carry them off; but failing herein, they in the next place\\ntied ropes to them, and set to work to try if they could haul them\\ndown. In the midst of their hauling suddenly there was a thunderclap,\\nand with the thunderclap an earthquake; and the crew of the trireme\\nwere forthwith seized with madness, and, like enemies, began to kill\\none another; until at last there was but one left, who returned alone\\nto Phalerum. \\n\\nSuch is the account given by the Athenians. The Eginetans deny that\\nthere was only a single vessel- \"Had there been only one,\" they say,\\n\"or no more than a few, they would easily have repulsed the attack,\\neven if they had had no fleet at all; but the Athenians came against\\nthem with a large number of ships, wherefore they gave way, and did\\nnot hazard a battle.\" They do not however explain clearly whether\\nit was from a conviction of their own inferiority at sea that they\\nyielded, or whether it was for the purpose of doing that which in\\nfact they did. Their account is that the Athenians, disembarking from\\ntheir ships, when they found that no resistance was offered, made\\nfor the statues, and failing to wrench them from their pedestals,\\ntied ropes to them and began to haul. Then, they say- and some people\\nwill perhaps believe them, though I for my part do not- the two statues,\\nas they were being dragged and hauled, fell down both upon their knees;\\nin which attitude they still remain. Such, according to them, was\\nthe conduct of the Athenians; they meanwhile, having learnt beforehand\\nwhat was intended, had prevailed on the Argives to hold themselves\\nin readiness; and the Athenians accordingly were but just landed on\\ntheir coasts when the Argives came to their aid. Secretly and silently\\nthey crossed over from Epidaurus, and, before the Athenians were aware,\\ncut off their retreat to their ships, and fell upon them; and the\\nthunder came exactly at that moment, and the earthquake with it.\\n\\nThe Argives and the Eginetans both agree in giving this account; and\\nthe Athenians themselves acknowledge that but one of their men returned\\nalive to Attica. According to the Argives, he escaped from the battle\\nin which the rest of the Athenian troops were destroyed by them. According\\nto the Athenians, it was the god who destroyed their troops; and even\\nthis one man did not escape, for he perished in the following manner.\\nWhen he came back to Athens, bringing word of the calamity, the wives\\nof those who had been sent out on the expedition took it sorely to\\nheart that he alone should have survived the slaughter of all the\\nrest;- they therefore crowded round the man, and struck him with the\\nbrooches by which their dresses were fastened each, as she struck,\\nasking him where he had left her husband. And the man died in this\\nway. The Athenians thought the deed of the women more horrible even\\nthan the fate of the troops; as however they did not know how else\\nto punish them, they changed their dress and compelled them to wear\\nthe costume of the Ionians. Till this time the Athenian women had\\nworn a Dorian dress, shaped nearly like that which prevails at Corinth.\\nHenceforth they were made to wear the linen tunic, which does not\\nrequire brooches. \\n\\nIn very truth, however, this dress is not originally Ionian, but Carian;\\nfor anciently the Greek women all wore the costume which is now called\\nthe Dorian. It is said further that the Argives and Eginetans made\\nit a custom, on this same account, for their women to wear brooches\\nhalf as large again as formerly, and to offer brooches rather than\\nanything else in the temple of these goddesses. They also forbade\\nthe bringing of anything Attic into the temple, were it even a jar\\nof earthenware, and made a law that none but native drinking vessels\\nshould be used there in time to come. From this early age to my own\\nday the Argive and Eginetan women have always continued to wear their\\nbrooches larger than formerly, through hatred of the Athenians.\\n\\nSuch then was the origin of the feud which existed between the Eginetans\\nand the Athenians. Hence, when the Thebans made their application\\nfor succour, the Eginetans, calling to mind the matter of images,\\ngladly lent their aid to the Boeotians. They ravaged all the sea-coast\\nof Attica; and the Athenians were about to attack them in return,\\nwhen they were stopped by the oracle of Delphi, which bade them wait\\ntill thirty years had passed from the time that the Eginetans did\\nthe wrong, and in the thirty-first year, having first set apart a\\nprecinct for Aeacus, then to begin the war. \"So should they succeed\\nto their wish,\" the oracle said; \"but if they went to war at once,\\nthough they would still conquer the island in the end, yet they must\\ngo through much suffering and much exertion before taking it.\" On\\nreceiving this warning the Athenians set apart a precinct for Aeacus-\\nthe same which still remains dedicated to him in their market-place-\\nbut they could not hear with any patience of waiting thirty years,\\nafter they had suffered such grievous wrong at the hands of the Eginetans.\\n\\nAccordingly they were making ready to take their revenge when a fresh\\nstir on the part of the Lacedaemonians hindered their projects. These\\nlast had become aware of the truth- how that the Alcmaeonidae had\\npractised on the Pythoness, and the Pythoness had schemed against\\nthemselves, and against the Pisistratidae; and the discovery was a\\ndouble grief to them, for while they had driven their own sworn friends\\ninto exile, they found that they had not gained thereby a particle\\nof good will from Athens. They were also moved by certain prophecies,\\nwhich declared that many dire calamities should befall them at the\\nhands of the Athenians. Of these in times past they had been ignorant;\\nbut now they had become acquainted with them by means of Cleomenes,\\nwho had brought them with him to Sparta, having found them in the\\nAthenian citadel, where they had been left by the Pisistratidae when\\nthey were driven from Athens: they were in the temple, and Cleomenes\\nhaving discovered them, carried them off. \\n\\nSo when the Lacedaemonians obtained possession of the prophecies,\\nand saw that the Athenians were growing in strength, and had no mind\\nto acknowledge any subjection to their control, it occurred to them\\nthat, if the people of Attica were free, they would be likely to be\\nas powerful as themselves, but if they were oppressed by a tyranny,\\nthey would be weak and submissive. Under this feeling they sent and\\nrecalled Hippias, the son of Pisistratus, from Sigeum upon the Hellespont,\\nwhere the Pisistratidae had taken shelter. Hippias came at their bidding,\\nand the Spartans on his arrival summoned deputies from all their other\\nallies, and thus addressed the assembly:- \\n\\n\"Friends and brothers in arms, we are free to confess that we did\\nlately a thing which was not right. Misled by counterfeit oracles,\\nwe drove from their country those who were our sworn and true friends,\\nand who had, moreover, engaged to keep Athens in dependence upon us;\\nand we delivered the government into the hands of an unthankful people-\\na people who no sooner got their freedom by our means, and grew in\\npower, than they turned us and our king, with every token of insult,\\nout of their city. Since then they have gone on continually raising\\ntheir thoughts higher, as their neighbours of Boeotia and Chalcis\\nhave already discovered to their cost, and as others too will presently\\ndiscover if they shall offend them. Having thus erred, we will endeavour\\nnow, with your help, to remedy the evils we have caused, and to obtain\\nvengeance on the Athenians. For this cause we have sent for Hippias\\nto come here, and have summoned you likewise from your several states,\\nthat we may all now with heart and hand unite to restore him to Athens,\\nand thereby give him back that which we took from him formerly.\"\\n\\n(SS 1.) Such was the address of the Spartans. The greater number of\\nthe allies listened without being persuaded. None however broke silence\\nbut Sosicles the Corinthian, who exclaimed- \\n\\n\"Surely the heaven will soon be below, and the earth above, and men\\nwill henceforth live in the sea, and fish take their place upon the\\ndry land, since you, Lacedaemonians, propose to put down free governments\\nin the cities of Greece, and to set up tyrannies in their room. There\\nis nothing in the whole world so unjust, nothing so bloody, as a tyranny.\\nIf, however, it seems to you a desirable thing to have the cities\\nunder despotic rule, begin by putting a tyrant over yourselves, and\\nthen establish despots in the other states. While you continue yourselves,\\nas you have always been, unacquainted with tyranny, and take such\\nexcellent care that Sparta may not suffer from it, to act as you are\\nnow doing is to treat your allies unworthily. If you knew what tyranny\\nwas as well as ourselves, you would be better advised than you now\\nare in regard to it. (SS 2.) The government at Corinth was once an\\noligarchy - a single race, called Bacchiadae, who intermarried only\\namong themselves, held the management of affairs. Now it happened\\nthat Amphion, one of these, had a daughter, named Labda, who was lame,\\nand whom therefore none of the Bacchiadae would consent to marry;\\nso she was taken to wife by Aetion, son of Echecrates, a man of the\\ntownship of Petra, who was, however, by descent of the race of the\\nLapithae, and of the house of Caeneus. Aetion, as he had no child,\\neither by this wife or by any other, went to Delphi to consult the\\noracle concerning the matter. Scarcely had he entered the temple when\\nthe Pythoness saluted him in these words- \\n\\nNo one honours thee now, Aetion, worthy of honour- \\nLabda shall soon be a mother- her offspring a rock, that will one\\nday \\nFall on the kingly race, and right the city of Corinth. By some chance\\nthis address of the oracle to Aetion came to the ears of the Bacchiadae,\\nwho till then had been unable to perceive the meaning of another earlier\\nprophecy which likewise bore upon Corinth, and pointed to the same\\nevent as Aetion\\'s prediction. It was the following:- \\n\\nWhen mid the rocks an eagle shall bear a carnivorous lion,\\n\\nMighty and fierce, he shall loosen the limbs of many beneath them-\\n\\nBrood ye well upon this, all ye Corinthian people, \\nYe who dwell by fair Peirene, and beetling Corinth. \\n\\n(SS 3.) The Bacchiadae had possessed this oracle for some time; but\\nthey were quite at a loss to know what it meant until they heard the\\nresponse given to Aetion; then however they at once perceived its\\nmeaning, since the two agreed so well together. Nevertheless, though\\nthe bearing of the first prophecy was now clear to them, they remained\\nquiet, being minded to put to death the child which Aetion was expecting.\\nAs soon, therefore, as his wife was delivered, they sent ten of their\\nnumber to the township where Aetion lived, with orders to make away\\nwith the baby. So the men came to Petra, and went into Aetion\\'s house,\\nand there asked if they might see the child; and Labda, who knew nothing\\nof their purpose, but thought their inquiries arose from a kindly\\nfeeling towards her husband, brought the child, and laid him in the\\narms of one of them. Now they had agreed by the way that whoever first\\ngot hold of the child should dash it against the ground. It happened,\\nhowever, by a providential chance, that the babe, just as Labda put\\nhim into the man\\'s arms, smiled in his face. The man saw the smile,\\nand was touched with pity, so that he could not kill it; he therefore\\npassed it on to his next neighbour, who gave it to a third; and so\\nit went through all the ten without any one choosing to be the murderer.\\nThe mother received her child back; and the men went out of the house,\\nand stood near the door, and there blamed and reproached one another;\\nchiefly however accusing the man who had first had the child in his\\narms, because he had not done as had been agreed upon. At last, after\\nmuch time had been thus spent, they resolved to go into the house\\nagain and all take part in the murder. (SS 4.) But it was fated that\\nevil should come upon Corinth from the progeny of Aetion; and so it\\nchanced that Labda, as she stood near the door, heard all that the\\nmen said to one another, and fearful of their changing their mind,\\nand returning to destroy her baby, she carried him off and hid him\\nin what seemed to her the most unlikely place to be suspected, viz.,\\na \\'cypsel\\' or corn-bin. She knew that if they came back to look for\\nthe child, they would search all her house; and so indeed they did,\\nbut not finding the child after looking everywhere, they thought it\\nbest to go away, and declare to those by whom they had been sent that\\nthey had done their bidding. And thus they reported on their return\\nhome. (SS 5.) Aetion\\'s son grew up, and, in remembrance of the danger\\nfrom which he had escaped, was named Cypselus, after the cornbin.\\nWhen he reached to man\\'s estate, he went to Delphi, and on consulting\\nthe oracle, received a response which was two-sided. It was the following:\\n\\nSee there comes to my dwelling a man much favour\\'d of fortune,\\n\\nCypselus, son of Aetion, and king of the glorious Corinth-\\n\\nHe and his children too, but not his children\\'s children. Such was\\nthe oracle; and Cypselus put so much faith in it that he forthwith\\nmade his attempt, and thereby became master of Corinth. Having thus\\ngot the tyranny, he showed himself a harsh ruler- many of the Corinthians\\nhe drove into banishment, many he deprived of their fortunes, and\\na still greater number of their lives. (SS 6.) His reign lasted thirty\\nyears, and was prosperous to its close; insomuch that he left the\\ngovernment to Periander, his son. This prince at the beginning of\\nhis reign was of a milder temper than his father; but after he corresponded\\nby means of messengers with Thrasybulus, tyrant of Miletus, he became\\neven more sanguinary. On one occasion he sent a herald to ask Thrasybulus\\nwhat mode of government it was safest to set up in order to rule with\\nhonour. Thrasybulus led the messenger without the city, and took him\\ninto a field of corn, through which he began to walk, while he asked\\nhim again and again concerning his coming from Corinth, ever as he\\nwent breaking off and throwing away all such ears of corn as over-topped\\nthe rest. In this way he went through the whole field, and destroyed\\nall the best and richest part of the crop; then, without a word, he\\nsent the messenger back. On the return of the man to Corinth, Periander\\nwas eager to know what Thrasybulus had counselled, but the messenger\\nreported that he had said nothing; and he wondered that Periander\\nhad sent him to so strange a man, who seemed to have lost his senses,\\nsince he did nothing but destroy his own property. And upon this he\\ntold how Thrasybulus had behaved at the interview. (SS 7.) Periander,\\nperceiving what the action meant, and knowing that Thrasybulus advised\\nthe destruction of all the leading citizens, treated his subjects\\nfrom this time forward with the very greatest cruelty. Where Cypselus\\nhad spared any, and had neither put them to death nor banished them,\\nPeriander completed what his father had left unfinished. One day he\\nstripped all the women of Corinth stark naked, for the sake of his\\nown wife Melissa. He had sent messengers into Thesprotia to consult\\nthe oracle of the dead upon the Acheron concerning a pledge which\\nhad been given into his charge by a stranger, and Melissa appeared,\\nbut refused to speak or tell where the pledge was- \\'she was chill,\\'\\nshe said, \\'having no clothes; the garments buried with her were of\\nno manner of use, since they had not been burnt. And this should be\\nher token to Periander, that what she said was true- the oven was\\ncold when he baked his loaves in it.\\' When this message was brought\\nhim, Periander knew the token; wherefore he straightway made proclamation,\\nthat all the wives of the Corinthians should go forth to the temple\\nof Juno. So the women apparelled themselves in their bravest, and\\nwent forth, as if to a festival. Then, with the help of his guards,\\nwhom he had placed for the purpose, he stripped them one and all,\\nmaking no difference between the free women and the slaves; and, taking\\ntheir clothes to a pit, he called on the name of Melissa, and burnt\\nthe whole heap. This done, he sent a second time to the oracle; and\\nMelissa\\'s ghost told him where he would find the stranger\\'s pledge.\\nSuch, O Lacedaemonians! is tyranny, and such are the deeds which spring\\nfrom it. We Corinthians marvelled greatly when we first knew of your\\nhaving sent for Hippias; and now it surprises us still more to hear\\nyou speak as you do. We adjure you, by the common gods of Greece,\\nplant not despots in her cities. If however you are determined, if\\nyou persist, against all justice, in seeking to restore Hippias- know,\\nat least, that the Corinthians will not approve your conduct.\"\\n\\nWhen Sosicles, the deputy from Corinth, had thus spoken, Hippias replied,\\nand, invoking the same gods, he said-\"Of a surety the Corinthians\\nwill, beyond all others, regret the Pisistratidae, when the fated\\ndays come for them to be distressed by the Athenians.\" Hippias spoke\\nthus because he knew the prophecies better than any man living. But\\nthe rest of the allies, who till Sosicles spoke had remained quiet,\\nwhen they heard him utter his thoughts thus boldly, all together broke\\nsilence, and declared themselves of the same mind; and withal, they\\nconjured the Lacedaemonians \"not to revolutionise a Grecian city.\"\\nAnd in this way the enterprise came to nought. \\n\\nHippias hereupon withdrew; and Amyntas the Macedonian offered him\\nthe city of Anthemus, while the Thessalians were willing to give him\\nIolcos: but he would accept neither the one nor the other, preferring\\nto go back to Sigeum, which city Pisistratus had taken by force of\\narms from the Mytilenaeans. Pisistratus, when he became master of\\nthe place, established there as tyrant his own natural son, Hegesistratus,\\nwhose mother was an Argive woman. But this prince was not allowed\\nto enjoy peaceably what his father had made over to him; for during\\nvery many years there had been war between the Athenians of Sigeum\\nand the Mytilenaeans of the city called Achilleum. They of Mytilene\\ninsisted on having the place restored to them: but the Athenians refused,\\nsince they argued that the Aeolians had no better claim to the Trojan\\nterritory than themselves, or than any of the other Greeks who helped\\nMenelaus on occasion of the rape of Helen. \\n\\nWar accordingly continued, with many and various incidents, whereof\\nthe following was one. In a battle which was gained by the Athenians,\\nthe poet Alcaeus took to flight, and saved himself, but lost his arms,\\nwhich fell into the hands of the conquerors. They hung them up in\\nthe temple of Minerva at Sigeum; and Alcaeus made a poem, describing\\nhis misadventure to his friend Melanippus, and sent it to him at Mytilene.\\nThe Mytilenaeans and Athenians were reconciled by Periander, the son\\nof Cypselus, who was chosen by both parties as arbiter- he decided\\nthat they should each retain that of which they were at the time possessed;\\nand Sigeum passed in this way under the dominion of Athens.\\n\\nOn the return of Hippias to Asia from Lacedaemon, he moved heaven\\nand earth to set Artaphernes against the Athenians, and did all that\\nlay in his power to bring Athens into subjection to himself and Darius.\\nSo when the Athenians learnt what he was about, they sent envoys to\\nSardis, and exhorted the Persians not to lend an ear to the Athenian\\nexiles. Artaphernes told them in reply, \"that if they wished to remain\\nsafe, they must receive back Hippias.\" The Athenians, when this answer\\nwas reported to them, determined not to consent, and therefore made\\nup their minds to be at open enmity with the Persians. \\n\\nThe Athenians had come to this decision, and were already in bad odour\\nwith the Persians, when Aristagoras the Milesian, dismissed from Sparta\\nby Cleomenes the Lacedaemonian, arrived at Athens. He knew that, after\\nSparta, Athens was the most powerful of the Grecian states. Accordingly\\nhe appeared before the people, and, as he had done at Sparta, spoke\\nto them of the good things which there were in Asia, and of the Persian\\nmode of fight- how they used neither shield nor spear, and were very\\neasy to conquer. All this he urged, and reminded them also that Miletus\\nwas a colony from Athens, and therefore ought to receive their succour,\\nsince they were so powerful- and in the earnestness of his entreaties,\\nhe cared little what he promised- till, at the last, he prevailed\\nand won them over. It seems indeed to be easier to deceive a multitude\\nthan one man- for Aristagoras, though he failed to impose on Cleomenes\\nthe Lacedaemonian, succeeded with the Athenians, who were thirty thousand.\\nWon by his persuasions, they voted that twenty ships should be sent\\nto the aid of the Ionians, under the command of Melanthius, one of\\nthe citizens, a man of mark in every way. These ships were the beginning\\nof mischief both to the Greeks and to the barbarians. \\n\\nAristagoras sailed away in advance, and when he reached Miletus, devised\\na plan, from which no manner of advantage could possibly accrue to\\nthe Ionians;- indeed, in forming it, he did not aim at their benefit,\\nbut his sole wish was to annoy King Darius. He sent a messenger into\\nPhrygia to those Paeonians who had been led away captive by Megabazus\\nfrom the river Strymon, and who now dwelt by themselves in Phrygia,\\nhaving a tract of land and a hamlet of their own. This man, when he\\nreached the Paeonians, spoke thus to them:- \\n\\n\"Men of Paeonia, Aristagoras, king of Miletus, has sent me to you,\\nto inform you that you may now escape, if you choose to follow the\\nadvice he proffers. All Ionia has revolted from the king; and the\\nway is open to you to return to your own land. You have only to contrive\\nto reach the sea-coast; the rest shall be our business.\"\\n\\nWhen the Paeonians heard this, they were exceedingly rejoiced, and,\\ntaking with them their wives and children, they made all speed to\\nthe coast; a few only remaining in Phrygia through fear. The rest,\\nhaving reached the sea, crossed over to Chios, where they had just\\nlanded, when a great troop of Persian horse came following upon their\\nheels, and seeking to overtake them. Not succeeding, however, they\\nsent a message across to Chios, and begged the Paeonians to come back\\nagain. These last refused, and were conveyed by the Chians from Chios\\nto Lesbos, and by the Lesbians thence to Doriscus; from which place\\nthey made their way on foot to Paeonia. \\n\\nThe Athenians now arrived with a fleet of twenty sail, and brought\\nalso in their company five triremes of the Eretrians; which had joined\\nthe expedition, not so much out of goodwill towards Athens, as to\\npay a debt which they already owed to the people of Miletus. For in\\nthe old war between the Chalcideans and Eretrians, the Milesians fought\\non the Eretrian side throughout, while the Chalcideans had the help\\nof the Samian people. Aristagoras, on their arrival, assembled the\\nrest of his allies, and proceeded to attack Sardis, not however leading\\nthe army in person, but appointing to the command his own brother\\nCharopinus and Hermophantus, one of the citizens, while he himself\\nremained behind in Miletus. \\n\\nThe Ionians sailed with this fleet to Ephesus, and, leaving their\\nships at Coressus in the Ephesian territory, took guides from the\\ncity, and went up the country with a great host. They marched along\\nthe course of the river Cayster, and, crossing over the ridge of Tmolus,\\ncame down upon Sardis and took it, no man opposing them;- the whole\\ncity fell into their hands, except only the citadel, which Artaphernes\\ndefended in person, having with him no contemptible force.\\n\\nThough, however, they took the city, they did not succeed in plundering\\nit; for, as the houses in Sardis were most of them built of reeds,\\nand even the few which were of brick had a reed thatching for their\\nroof, one of them was no sooner fired by a soldier than the flames\\nran speedily from house to house, and spread over the whole place.\\nAs the fire raged, the Lydians and such Persians as were in the city,\\ninclosed on every side by the flames, which had seized all the skirts\\nof the town, and finding themselves unable to get out, came in crowds\\ninto the market-place, and gathered themselves upon the banks of the\\nPactolus This stream, which comes down from Mount Tmolus, and brings\\nthe Sardians a quantity of gold-dust, runs directly through the market\\nplace of Sardis, and joins the Hermus, before that river reaches the\\nsea. So the Lydians and Persians, brought together in this way in\\nthe market-place and about the Pactolus, were forced to stand on their\\ndefence; and the Ionians, when they saw the enemy in part resisting,\\nin part pouring towards them in dense crowds, took fright, and drawing\\noff to the ridge which is called Tmolus when night came, went back\\nto their ships. \\n\\nSardis however was burnt, and, among other buildings, a temple of\\nthe native goddess Cybele was destroyed; which was the reason afterwards\\nalleged by the Persians for setting on fire the temples of the Greeks.\\nAs soon as what had happened was known, all the Persians who were\\nstationed on this side the Halys drew together, and brought help to\\nthe Lydians. Finding however, when they arrived, that the Ionians\\nhad already withdrawn from Sardis, they set off, and, following close\\nupon their track, came up with them at Ephesus. The Ionians drew out\\nagainst them in battle array; and a fight ensued, wherein the Greeks\\nhad very greatly the worse. Vast numbers were slain by the Persians:\\namong other men of note, they killed the captain of the Eretrians,\\na certain Eualcidas, a man who had gained crowns at the Games, and\\nreceived much praise from Simonides the Cean. Such as made their escape\\nfrom the battle, dispersed among the several cities. \\n\\nSo ended this encounter. Afterwards the Athenians quite forsook the\\nIonians, and, though Aristagoras besought them much by his ambassadors,\\nrefused to give him any further help. Still the Ionians, notwithstanding\\nthis desertion, continued unceasingly their preparations to carry\\non the war against the Persian king, which their late conduct towards\\nhim had rendered unavoidable. Sailing into the Hellespont, they brought\\nByzantium, and all the other cities in that quarter, under their sway.\\nAgain, quitting the Hellespont, they went to Caria, and won the greater\\npart of the Carians to their side; while Caunus, which had formerly\\nrefused to join with them, after the burning of Sardis, came over\\nlikewise. \\n\\nAll the Cyprians too, excepting those of Amathus, of their own proper\\nmotion espoused the Ionian cause. The occasion of their revolting\\nfrom the Medes was the following. There was a certain Onesilus, younger\\nbrother of Gorgus, king of Salamis, and son of Chersis, who was son\\nof Siromus, and grandson of Evelthon. This man had often in former\\ntimes entreated Gorgus to rebel against the king; but, when he heard\\nof the revolt of the Ionians, he left him no peace with his importunity.\\nAs, however, Gorgus would not hearken to him, he watched his occasion,\\nand when his brother had gone outside the town, he with his partisans\\nclosed the gates upon him. Gorgus, thus deprived of his city, fled\\nto the Medes; and Onesilus, being now king of Salamis, sought to bring\\nabout a revolt of the whole of Cyprus. All were prevailed on except\\nthe Amathusians, who refused to listen to him; whereupon Onesilus\\nsate down before Amathus, and laid siege to it. \\n\\nWhile Onesilus was engaged in the siege of Amathus, King Darius received\\ntidings of the taking and burning of Sardis by the Athenians and Ionians;\\nand at the same time he learnt that the author of the league, the\\nman by whom the whole matter had been Planned and contrived, was Aristagoras\\nthe Milesian. It is said that he no sooner understood what had happened,\\nthan, laying aside all thought concerning the Ionians, who would,\\nhe was sure, pay dear for their rebellion, he asked, \"Who the Athenians\\nwere?\" and, being informed, called for his bow, and placing an arrow\\non the string, shot upward into the sky, saying, as he let fly the\\nshaft- \"Grant me, Jupiter, to revenge myself on the Athenians!\" After\\nthis speech, he bade one of his servants every day, when his dinner\\nwas spread, three times repeat these words to him- \"Master, remember\\nthe Athenians.\" \\n\\nThen he summoned into his presence Histiaeus if Miletus, whom he had\\nkept at his court for so long a time; and on his appearance addressed\\nhim thus \"I am told, O Histiaeus, that thy lieutenant, to whom thou\\nhast given Miletus in charge, has raised a rebellion against me. He\\nhas brought men from the other continent to contend with me, and,\\nprevailing on the Ionians- whose conduct I shall know how to recompense-\\nto join with this force, he has robbed me of Sardis! Is this as it\\nshould be, thinkest thou Or can it have been done without thy knowledge\\nand advice? Beware lest it be found hereafter that the blame of these\\nacts is thine.\" \\n\\nHistiaeus answered- \"What words are these, O king, to which thou hast\\ngiven utterance? I advise aught from which unpleasantness of any kind,\\nlittle or great, should come to thee! What could I gain by so doing?\\nOr what is there that I lack now? Have I not all that thou hast, and\\nam I not thought worthy to partake all thy counsels? If my lieutenant\\nhas indeed done as thou sayest, be sure he has done it all of his\\nown head. For my part, I do not think it can really be that the Milesians\\nand my lieutenant have raised a rebellion against thee. But if they\\nhave indeed committed aught to thy hurt, and the tidings are true\\nwhich have come to thee, judge thou how ill-advised thou wert to remove\\nme from the sea-coast. The Ionians, it seems, have waited till I was\\nno longer in sight, and then sought to execute that which they long\\nago desired; whereas, if I had been there, not a single city would\\nhave stirred. Suffer me then to hasten at my best speed to Ionia,\\nthat I may place matters there upon their former footing, and deliver\\nup to thee the deputy of Miletus, who has caused all the troubles.\\nHaving managed this business to thy heart\\'s content, I swear by all\\nthe gods of thy royal house, I will not put off the clothes in which\\nI reach Ionia till I have made Sardinia, the biggest island in the\\nworld, thy tributary.\" \\n\\nHistiaeus spoke thus, wishing to deceive the king; and Darius, persuaded\\nby his words, let him go; only bidding him be sure to do as he had\\npromised, and afterwards come back to Susa. \\n\\nIn the meantime- while the tidings of the burning of Sardis were reaching\\nthe king, and Darius was shooting the arrow and having the conference\\nwith Histiaeus, and the latter, by permission of Darius, was hastening\\ndown to the sea- in Cyprus the following events took place. Tidings\\ncame to Onesilus, the Salaminian, who was still besieging Amathus,\\nthat a certain Artybius, a Persian, was looked for to arrive in Cyprus\\nwith a great Persian armament. So Onesilus, when the news reached\\nhim, sent off heralds to all parts of Ionia, and besought the Ionians\\nto give him aid. After brief deliberation, these last in full force\\npassed over into the island; and the Persians about the same time\\ncrossed in their ships from Cilicia, and proceeded by land to attack\\nSalamis; while the Phoenicians, with the fleet, sailed round the promontory\\nwhich goes by the name of \"the Keys of Cyprus.\" \\n\\nIn this posture of affairs the princes of Cyprus called together the\\ncaptains of the Ionians, and thus addressed them:- \\n\\n\"Men of Ionia, we Cyprians leave it to you to choose whether you will\\nfight with the Persians or with the Phoenicians. If it be your pleasure\\nto try your strength on land against the Persians, come on shore at\\nonce, and array yourselves for the battle; we will then embark aboard\\nyour ships and engage the Phoenicians by sea. If, on the other hand,\\nye prefer to encounter the Phoenicians, let that be your task: only\\nbe sure, whichever part you choose, to acquit yourselves so that Ionia\\nand Cyprus, so far as depends on you, may preserve their freedom.\"\\n\\nThe Ionians made answer- \"The commonwealth of Ionia sent us here to\\nguard the sea, not to make over our ships to you, and engage with\\nthe Persians on shore. We will therefore keep the post which has been\\nassigned to us, and seek therein to be of some service. Do you, remembering\\nwhat you suffered when you were the slaves of the Medes, behave like\\nbrave warriors.\" \\n\\nSuch was the reply of the Ionians. Not long afterwards the Persians\\nadvanced into the plain before Salamis, and the Cyprian kings ranged\\ntheir troops in order of battle against them, placing them so that\\nwhile the rest of the Cyprians were drawn up against the auxiliaries\\nof the enemy, the choicest troops of the Salaminians and the Solians\\nwere set to oppose the Persians. At the same time Onesilus, of his\\nown accord, took post opposite to Artybius, the Persian general.\\n\\nNow Artybius rode a horse which had been trained to rear up against\\na foot-soldier. Onesilus, informed of this, called to him his shield-bearer,\\nwho was a Carian by nation, a man well skilled in war, and of daring\\ncourage; and thus addressed him:- \"I hear,\" he said, \"that the horse\\nwhich Artybius rides, rears up and attacks with his fore legs and\\nteeth the man against whom his rider urges him. Consider quickly therefore\\nand tell me which wilt thou undertake to encounter, the steed or the\\nrider?\" Then the squire answered him, \"Both, my liege, or either,\\nam I ready to undertake, and there is nothing that I will shrink from\\nat thy bidding. But I will tell thee what seems to me to make most\\nfor thy interests. As thou art a prince and a general, I think thou\\nshouldest engage with one who is himself both a prince and also a\\ngeneral. For then, if thou slayest thine adversary, \\'twill redound\\nto thine honour, and if he slays thee (which may Heaven forefend!),\\nyet to fall by the hand of a worthy foe makes death lose half its\\nhorror. To us, thy followers, leave his war-horse and his retinue.\\nAnd have thou no fear of the horse\\'s tricks. I warrant that this is\\nthe last time he will stand up against any one.\" \\n\\nThus spake the Carian; and shortly after, the two hosts joined battle\\nboth by sea and land. And here it chanced that by sea the Ionians,\\nwho that day fought as they have never done either before or since,\\ndefeated the Phoenicians, the Samians especially distinguishing themselves.\\nMeanwhile the combat had begun on land, and the two armies were engaged\\nin a sharp struggle, when thus it fell out in the matter of the generals.\\nArtybius, astride upon his horse, charged down upon Onesilus, who,\\nas he had agreed with his shield-bearer, aimed his blow at the rider;\\nthe horse reared and placed his fore feet upon the shield of Onesilus,\\nwhen the Carian cut at him with a reaping-hook, and severed the two\\nlegs from the body. The horse fell upon the spot, and Artybius, the\\nPersian general, with him. \\n\\nIn the thick of the fight, Stesanor, tyrant of Curium, who commanded\\nno inconsiderable body of troops, went over with them to the enemy.\\nOn this desertion of the Curians- Argive colonists, if report says\\ntrue- forthwith the war-chariots of the Salaminians followed the example\\nset them, and went over likewise; whereupon victory declared in favour\\nof the Persians; and the army of the Cyprians being routed, vast numbers\\nwere slain, and among them Onesilus, the son of Chersis, who was the\\nauthor of the revolt, and Aristocyprus, king of the Solians. This\\nAristocyprus was son of Philocyprus, whom Solon the Athenian, when\\nhe visited Cyprus, praised in his poems beyond all other sovereigns.\\n\\nThe Amathusians, because Onesilus had laid siege to their town, cut\\nthe head off his corpse, and took it with them to Amathus, where it\\nwas set up over the gates. Here it hung till it became hollow; whereupon\\na swarm of bees took possession of it, and filled it with a honeycomb.\\nOn seeing this the Amathusians consulted the oracle, and were commanded\\n\"to take down the head and bury it, and thenceforth to regard Onesilus\\nas a hero, and offer sacrifice to him year by year; so it would go\\nthe better with them.\" And to this day the Amathusians do as they\\nwere then bidden. \\n\\nAs for the Ionians who had gained the sea-fight, when they found that\\nthe affairs of Onesilus were utterly lost and ruined, and that siege\\nwas laid to all the cities of Cyprus excepting Salamis, which the\\ninhabitants had surrendered to Gorgus, the former king, forthwith\\nthey left Cyprus, and sailed away home. Of the cities which were besieged,\\nSoli held out the longest: the Persians took it by undermining the\\nwall in the fifth month from the beginning of the siege.\\n\\nThus, after enjoying a year of freedom, the Cyprians were enslaved\\nfor the second time. Meanwhile Daurises, who was married to one of\\nthe daughters of Darius, together with Hymeas, Otanes, and other Persian\\ncaptains, who were likewise married to daughters of the king, after\\npursuing the Ionians who had fought at Sardis, defeating them, and\\ndriving them to their ships, divided their efforts against the different\\ncities, and proceeded in succession to take and sack each one of them.\\n\\nDaurises attacked the towns upon the Hellespont, and took in as many\\ndays the five cities of Dardanus, Abydos, Percote, Lampsacus, and\\nPaesus. From Paesus he marched against Parium; but on his way receiving\\nintelligence that the Carians had made common cause with the Ionians,\\nand thrown off the Persian yoke, he turned round, and, leaving the\\nHellespont, marched away towards Caria. \\n\\nThe Carians by some chance got information of this movement before\\nDaurises arrived, and drew together their strength to a place called\\n\"the White Columns,\" which is on the river Marsyas, a stream running\\nfrom the Idrian country, and emptying itself into the Maeander. Here\\nwhen they were met, many plans were put forth; but the best, in my\\njudgment, was that of Pixodarus, the son of Mausolus, a Cindyan, who\\nwas married to a daughter of Syennesis, the Cilician king. His advice\\nwas that the Carians should cross the Maeander, and fight with the\\nriver at their back; that so, all chance of flight being cut off,\\nthey might be forced to stand their ground, and have their natural\\ncourage raised to a still higher pitch. His opinion, however, did\\nnot prevail; it was thought best to make the enemy have the Maeander\\nbehind them; that so, if they were defeated in the battle and put\\nto flight, they might have no retreat open, but be driven headlong\\ninto the river. \\n\\nThe Persians soon afterwards approached, and, crossing the Maeander,\\nengaged the Carians upon the banks of the Marsyas; where for a long\\ntime the battle was stoutly contested, but at last the Carians were\\ndefeated, being overpowered by numbers. On the side of the Persians\\nthere fell 2000, while the Carians had not fewer than 10,000 slain.\\nSuch as escaped from the field of battle collected together at Labranda,\\nin the vast precinct of Jupiter Stratius- a deity worshipped only\\nby the Carians- and in the sacred grove of plane-trees. Here they\\ndeliberated as to the best means of saving themselves, doubting whether\\nthey would fare better if they gave themselves up to the Persians,\\nor if they abandoned Asia for ever. \\n\\nAs they were debating these matters a body of Milesians and allies\\ncame to their assistance; whereupon the Carians, dismissing their\\nformer thoughts, prepared themselves afresh for war, and on the approach\\nof the Persians gave them battle a second time. They were defeated,\\nhowever, with still greater loss than before; and while all the troops\\nengaged suffered severely, the blow fell with most force on the Milesians.\\n\\nThe Carians, some while after, repaired their ill fortune in another\\naction. Understanding that the Persians were about to attack their\\ncities, they laid an ambush for them on the road which leads to Pedasus;\\nthe Persians, who were making a night-march, fell into the trap, and\\nthe whole army was destroyed, together with the generals, Daurises,\\nAmorges, and Sisimaces: Myrsus too, the son of Gyges, was killed at\\nthe same time. The leader of the ambush was Heraclides, the son of\\nIbanolis, a man of Mylasa. Such was the way in which these Persians\\nperished. \\n\\nIn the meantime Hymeas, who was likewise one of those by whom the\\nIonians were pursued after their attack on Sardis, directing his course\\ntowards the Propontis, took Cius, a city of Mysia. Learning, however,\\nthat Daurises had left the Hellespont, and was gone into Caria, he\\nin his turn quitted the Propontis, and marching with the army under\\nhis command to the Hellespont, reduced all the Aeolians of the Troad,\\nand likewise conquered the Gergithae, a remnant of the ancient Teucrians.\\nHe did not, however, quit the Troad, but, after gaining these successes,\\nwas himself carried off by disease. \\n\\nAfter his death, which happened as have related, Artaphernes, the\\nsatrap of Sardis, and Otanes, the third general, were directed to\\nundertake the conduct of the war against Ionia and the neighbouring\\nAeolis. By them Clazomenae in the former, and Cyme in the latter,\\nwere recovered. \\n\\nAs the cities fell one after another, Aristagoras the Milesian (who\\nwas in truth, as he now plainly showed, a man of but little courage),\\nnotwithstanding that it was he who had caused the disturbances in\\nIonia and made so great a commotion, began, seeing his danger, to\\nlook about for means of escape. Being convinced that it was in vain\\nto endeavour to overcome King Darius, he called his brothers-in-arms\\ntogether, and laid before them the following project:- \"\\'Twould be\\nwell,\" he said, \"to have some place of refuge, in case they were driven\\nout of Miletus. Should he go out at the head of a colony to Sardinia,\\nor should he sail to Myrcinus in Edonia, which Histiaeus had received\\nas a gift from King Darius, and had begun to fortify?\" \\n\\nTo this question of Aristagoras, Hecataeus, the historian, son of\\nHegesander, made answer that in his judgement neither place was suitable.\\n\"Aristagoras should build a fort,\" he said, \"in the island of Leros,\\nand, if driven from Miletus, should go there and bide his time; from\\nLeros attacks might readily be made, and he might re-establish himself\\nin Miletus.\" Such was the advice given by Hecataeus. \\n\\nAristagoras, however, was bent on retiring to Myrcinus. Accordingly,\\nhe put the government of Miletus into the hands of one of the chief\\ncitizens, named Pythagoras, and, taking with him all who liked to\\ngo, sailed to Thrace, and there made himself master of the place in\\nquestion. From thence he proceeded to attack the Thracians; but here\\nhe was cut off with his whole army, while besieging a city whose defenders\\nwere anxious to accept terms of surrender. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK VI\\n\\nErato \\n\\nAristagoras, the author of the Ionian revolt, perished in the way\\nwhich I have described. Meanwhile Histiaeus, tyrant of Miletus, who\\nhad been allowed by Darius to leave Susa, came down to Sardis. On\\nhis arrival, being asked by Artaphernes, the Sardian satrap, what\\nhe thought was the reason that the Ionians had rebelled, he made answer\\nthat he could not conceive, and it had astonished him greatly, pretending\\nto be quite unconscious of the whole business. Artaphernes, however,\\nwho perceived that he was dealing dishonestly, and who had in fact\\nfull knowledge of the whole history of the outbreak, said to him,\\n\"I will tell thee how the case stands, Histiaeus: this shoe is of\\nthy stitching; Aristagoras has but put it on.\" \\n\\nSuch was the remark made by Artaphernes concerning the rebellion.\\nHistiaeus, alarmed at the knowledge which he displayed, so soon as\\nnight fell, fled away to the coast. Thus he forfeited his word to\\nDarius; for though he had pledged himself to bring Sardinia, the biggest\\nisland in the whole world, under the Persian yoke, he in reality sought\\nto obtain the direction of the war against the king. Crossing over\\nto Chios, he was there laid in bonds by the inhabitants, who accused\\nhim of intending some mischief against them in the interest of Darius.\\nHowever, when the whole truth was laid before them, and they found\\nthat Histiaeus was in reality a foe to the king, they forthwith set\\nhim at large again. \\n\\nAfter this the Ionians inquired of him for what reason he had so strongly\\nurged Aristagoras to revolt from the king, thereby doing their nation\\nso ill a service. In reply, he took good care not to disclose to them\\nthe real cause, but told them that King Darius had intended to remove\\nthe Phoenicians from their own country, and place them in Ionia, while\\nhe planted the Ionians in Phoenicia, and that it was for this reason\\nhe sent Aristagoras the order. Now it was not true that the king had\\nentertained any such intention, but Histiaeus succeeded hereby in\\narousing the fears of the Ionians. \\n\\nAfter this, Histiaeus, by means of a certain Hermippus, a native of\\nAtarneus, sent letters to many of the Persians in Sardis, who had\\nbefore held some discourse with him concerning a revolt. Hermippus,\\nhowever, instead of conveying them to the persons to whom they were\\naddressed, delivered them into the hands of Artaphernes, who, perceiving\\nwhat was on foot, commanded Hermippus to deliver the letters according\\nto their addresses, and then bring him back the answers which were\\nsent to Histiaeus. The traitors being in this way discovered, Artaphernes\\nput a number of Persians to death, and caused a commotion in Sardis.\\n\\nAs for Histiaeus, when his hopes in this matter were disappointed,\\nhe persuaded the Chians to carry him back to Miletus; but the Milesians\\nwere too well pleased at having got quit of Aristagoras to be anxious\\nto receive another tyrant into their country; besides which they had\\nnow tasted liberty. They therefore opposed his return; and when he\\nendeavoured to force an entrance during the night, one of the inhabitants\\neven wounded him in the thigh. Having been thus rejected from his\\ncountry, he went back to Chios; whence, after failing in an attempt\\nto induce the Chians to give him ships, he crossed over to Mytilene,\\nwhere he succeeded in obtaining vessels from the Lesbians. They fitted\\nout a squadron of eight triremes, and sailed with him to the Hellespont,\\nwhere they took up their station, and proceeded to seize all the vessels\\nwhich passed out from the Euxine, unless the crews declared themselves\\nready to obey his orders. \\n\\nWhile Histiaeus and the Mytilenaeans were thus employed, Miletus was\\nexpecting an attack from a vast armament, which comprised both a fleet\\nand also a land force. The Persian captains had drawn their several\\ndetachments together, and formed them into a single army; and had\\nresolved to pass over all the other cities, which they regarded as\\nof lesser account, and to march straight on Miletus. Of the naval\\nstates, Phoenicia showed the greatest zeal; but the fleet was composed\\nlikewise of the Cyprians (who had so lately been brought under), the\\nCilicians, and also the Egyptians. \\n\\nWhile the Persians were thus making preparations against Miletus and\\nIonia, the Ionians, informed of their intent, sent their deputies\\nto the Panionium, and held a council upon the posture of their affairs.\\nHereat it was determined that no land force should be collected to\\noppose the Persians, but that the Milesians should be left to defend\\ntheir own walls as they could; at the same time they agreed that the\\nwhole naval force of the states, not excepting a single ship, should\\nbe equipped, and should muster at Lade, a small island lying off Miletus-\\nto give battle on behalf of the place. \\n\\nPresently the Ionians began to assemble in their ships, and with them\\ncame the Aeolians of Lesbos; and in this way they marshalled their\\nline:- The wing towards the east was formed of the Milesians themselves,\\nwho furnished eighty ships; next to them came the Prienians with twelve,\\nand the Myusians with three ships; after the Myusians were stationed\\nthe Teians, whose ships were seventeen; then the Chians, who furnished\\na hundred. The Erythraeans and Phocaeans followed, the former with\\neight, the latter with three ships; beyond the Phocaeans were the\\nLesbians, furnishing seventy; last of all came the Samians, forming\\nthe western wing, and furnishing sixty vessels. The fleet amounted\\nin all to three hundred and fifty-three triremes. Such was the number\\non the Ionian side. \\n\\nOn the side of the barbarians the number of vessels was six hundred.\\nThese assembled off the coast of Milesia, while the land army collected\\nupon the shore; but the leaders, learning the strength of the Ionian\\nfleet, began to fear lest they might fail to defeat them, in which\\ncase, not having the mastery at sea, they would be unable to reduce\\nMiletus, and might in consequence receive rough treatment at the hands\\nof Darius. So when they thought of all these things, they resolved\\non the following course:- Calling together the Ionian tyrants, who\\nhad fled to the Medes for refuge when Aristagoras deposed them from\\ntheir governments, and who were now in camp, having joined in the\\nexpedition against Miletus, the Persians addressed them thus: \"Men\\nof Ionia, now is the fit time to show your zeal for the house of the\\nking. Use your best efforts, every one of you, to detach your fellow-countrymen\\nfrom the general body. Hold forth to them the promise that, if they\\nsubmit, no harm shall happen to them on account of their rebellion;\\ntheir temples shall not be burnt, nor any of their private buildings;\\nneither shall they be treated with greater harshness than before the\\noutbreak. But if they refuse to yield, and determine to try the chance\\nof a battle, threaten them with the fate which shall assuredly overtake\\nthem in that case. Tell them, when they are vanquished in fight, they\\nshall be enslaved; their boys shall be made eunuchs, and their maidens\\ntransported to Bactra; while their country shall be delivered into\\nthe hands of foreigners.\" \\n\\nThus spake the Persians. The Ionian tyrants sent accordingly by night\\nto their respective citizens, and reported the words of the Persians;\\nbut the people were all staunch, and refused to betray their countrymen,\\nthose of each state thinking that they alone had had made to them.\\nNow these events happened on the first appearance of the Persians\\nbefore Miletus. \\n\\nAfterwards, while the Ionian fleet was still assembled at Lade, councils\\nwere held, and speeches made by divers persons- among the rest by\\nDionysius, the Phocaean captain, who thus expressed himself:- \"Our\\naffairs hang on the razor\\'s edge, men of Ionia, either to be free\\nor to be slaves; and slaves, too, who have shown themselves runaways.\\nNow then you have to choose whether you will endure hardships, and\\nso for the present lead a life of toil, but thereby gain ability to\\novercome your enemies and establish your own freedom; or whether you\\nwill persist in this slothfulness and disorder, in which case I see\\nno hope of your escaping the king\\'s vengeance for your rebellion.\\nI beseech you, be persuaded by me, and trust yourselves to my guidance.\\nThen, if the gods only hold the balance fairly between us, I undertake\\nto say that our foes will either decline a battle, or, if they fight,\\nsuffer complete discomfiture.\" \\n\\nThese words prevailed with the Ionians, and forthwith they committed\\nthemselves to Dionysius; whereupon he proceeded every day to make\\nthe ships move in column, and the rowers ply their oars, and exercise\\nthemselves in breaking the line; while the marines were held under\\narms, and the vessels were kept, till evening fell, upon their anchors,\\nso that the men had nothing but toil from morning even to night. Seven\\ndays did the Ionians continue obedient, and do whatsoever he bade\\nthem; but on the eighth day, worn out by the hardness of the work\\nand the heat of the sun, and quite unaccustomed to such fatigues,\\nthey began to confer together, and to say one to another, \"What god\\nhave we offended to bring upon ourselves such a punishment as this?\\nFools and distracted that we were, to put ourselves into the hands\\nof this Phocaean braggart, who does but furnish three ships to the\\nfleet! He, now that he has got us, plagues us in the most desperate\\nfashion; many of us, in consequence, have fallen sick already- many\\nmore expect to follow. We had better suffer anything rather than these\\nhardships; even the slavery with which we are threatened, however\\nharsh, can be no worse than our present thraldom. Come, let us refuse\\nhim obedience.\" So saying, they forthwith ceased to obey his orders,\\nand pitched their tents, as if they had been soldiers, upon the island,\\nwhere they reposed under the shade all day, and refused to go aboard\\nthe ships and train themselves. \\n\\nNow when the Samian captains perceived what was taking place, they\\nwere more inclined than before to accept the terms which Aeaces, the\\nson of Syloson, had been authorised by the Persians to offer them,\\non condition of their deserting from the confederacy. For they saw\\nthat all was disorder among the Ionians, and they felt also that it\\nwas hopeless to contend with the power of the king; since if they\\ndefeated the fleet which had been sent against them, they knew that\\nanother would come five times as great. So they took advantage of\\nthe occasion which now offered, and as soon as ever they saw the Ionians\\nrefuse to work, hastened gladly to provide for the safety of their\\ntemples and their properties. This Aeaces, who made the overtures\\nto the Samians, was the son of Syloson, and grandson of the earlier\\nAeaces. He had formerly been tyrant of Samos, but was ousted from\\nhis government by Aristagoras the Milesian, at the same time with\\nthe other tyrants of the Ionians. \\n\\nThe Phoenicians soon afterwards sailed to the attack; and the Ionians\\nlikewise put themselves in line, and went out to meet them. When they\\nhad now neared one another, and joined battle, which of the Ionians\\nfought like brave men and which like cowards, I cannot declare with\\nany certainty, for charges are brought on all sides; but the tale\\ngoes that the Samians, according to the agreement which they had made\\nwith Aeaces, hoisted sail, and quitting their post bore away for Samos,\\nexcept eleven ships, whose captains gave no heed to the orders of\\nthe commanders, but remained and took part in the battle. The state\\nof Samos, in consideration of this action, granted to these men, as\\nan acknowledgment if their bravery, the honour of having their names,\\nand the names of their fathers, inscribed upon a pillar, which still\\nstands in the market-place. The Lesbians also, when they saw the Samians,\\nwho were drawn up next them, begin to flee, themselves did the like;\\nand the example, once set, was followed by the greater number of the\\nIonians. \\n\\nOf those who remained and fought, none were so rudely handled as the\\nChians, who displayed prodigies of valour, and disdained to play the\\npart of cowards. They furnished to the common fleet, as I mentioned\\nabove, one hundred ships, having each of them forty armed citizens,\\nand those picked men, on board; and when they saw the greater portion\\nof the allies betraying the common cause, they for their part, scorning\\nto imitate the base conduct of these traitors, although they were\\nleft almost alone and unsupported, a very few friends continuing to\\nstand by them, notwithstanding went on with the fight, and ofttimes\\ncut the line of the enemy, until at last, after they had taken very\\nmany of their adversaries\\' ships, they ended by losing more than half\\nof their own. Hereupon, with the remainder of their vessels, the Chians\\nfled away to their own country. \\n\\nAs for such of their ships as were damaged and disabled, these, being\\npursued by the enemy, made straight for Mycale, where the crews ran\\nthem ashore, and abandoning them began their march along the continent.\\nHappening in their way upon the territory of Ephesus, they essayed\\nto cross it; but here a dire misfortune befell them. It was night,\\nand the Ephesian women chanced to be engaged in celebrating the Thesmophoria-\\nthe previous calamity of the Chians had not been heard of- so when\\nthe Ephesians saw their country invaded by an armed band, they made\\nno question of the new-comers being robbers who purposed to carry\\noff their women; and accordingly they marched out against them in\\nfull force, and slew them all. Such were the misfortunes which befell\\nthem of Chios. \\n\\nDionysius, the Phocaean, when he perceived that all was lost, having\\nfirst captured three ships from the enemy, himself took to flight.\\nHe would not, however, return to Phocaea, which he well knew must\\nfall again, like the rest of Ionia, under the Persian yoke; but straightway,\\nas he was, he set sail for Phoenicia, and there sunk a number of merchantmen,\\nand gained a great booty; after which he directed his course to Sicily,\\nwhere he established himself as a corsair, and plundered the Carthaginians\\nand Tyrrhenians, but did no harm to the Greeks. \\n\\nThe Persians, when they had vanquished the Ionians in the sea-fight,\\nbesieged Miletus both by land and sea, driving mines under the walls,\\nand making use of every known device, until at length they took both\\nthe citadel and the town, six years from the time when the revolt\\nfirst broke out under Aristagoras. All the inhabitants of the city\\nthey reduced to slavery, and thus the event tallied with the announcement\\nwhich had been made by the oracle. \\n\\nFor once upon a time, when the Argives had sent to Delphi to consult\\nthe god about the safety of their own city, a prophecy was given them,\\nin which others besides themselves were interested; for while it bore\\nin part upon the fortunes of Argos, it touched in a by-clause the\\nfate of the men of Miletus. I shall set down the portion which concerned\\nthe Argives when I come to that part of my History, mentioning at\\npresent only the passage in which the absent Milesians were spoken\\nof. This passage was as follows:- \\n\\nThen shalt thou, Miletus, so oft the contriver of evil, \\nBe, thyself, to many a least and an excellent booty: \\nThen shall thy matrons wash the feet of long-haired masters-\\n\\nOthers shall then possess our lov\\'d Didymian temple. Such a fate now\\nbefell the Milesians; for the Persians, who wore their hair long,\\nafter killing most of the men, made the women and children slaves;\\nand the sanctuary at Didyma, the oracle no less than the temple was\\nplundered and burnt; of the riches whereof I have made frequent mention\\nin other parts of my History. \\n\\nThose of the Milesians whose lives were spared, being carried prisoners\\nto Susa, received no ill treatment at the hands of King Darius, but\\nwere established by him in Ampe, a city on the shores of the Erythraean\\nsea, near the spot where the Tigris flows into it. Miletus itself,\\nand the plain about the city, were kept by the Persians for themselves,\\nwhile the hill-country was assigned to the Carians of Pedasus.\\n\\nAnd now the Sybarites, who after the loss of their city occupied Laus\\nand Scidrus, failed duly to return the former kindness of the Milesians.\\nFor these last, when Sybaris was taken by the Crotoniats, made a great\\nmourning, all of them, youths as well as men, shaving their heads;\\nsince Miletus and Sybaris were, of all the cities whereof we have\\nany knowledge, the two most closely united to one another. The Athenians,\\non the other hand, showed themselves beyond measure afflicted at the\\nfall of Miletus, in many ways expressing their sympathy, and especially\\nby their treatment of Phrynichus. For when this poet brought out upon\\nthe stage his drama of the Capture of Miletus, the whole theatre burst\\ninto tears; and the people sentenced him to pay a fine of a thousand\\ndrachms, for recalling to them their own misfortunes. They likewise\\nmade a law that no one should ever again exhibit that piece.\\n\\nThus was Miletus bereft of its inhabitants. In Samos the people of\\nthe richer sort were much displeased with the doings of the captains,\\nand the dealings they had had the Medes; they therefore held a council,\\nvery shortly after the sea-fight, and resolved that they would not\\nremain to become the slaves of Aeaces and the Persians, but before\\nthe tyrant set foot in their country, would sail away and found a\\ncolony in another land. Now it chanced that about this time the Zanclaeans\\nof Sicily had sent ambassadors to the Ionians, and invited them to\\nKale-Acte where they wished an Ionian city to be founded. This place,\\nKale-Acte (or the Fair Strand) as it is called, is in the country\\nof the Sicilians, and is situated in the part of Sicily which looks\\ntowards Tyrrhenia. The offer thus made to all the Ionians was embraced\\nonly by the Samians, and by such of the Milesians as had contrived\\nto effect their escape. \\n\\nHereupon this is what ensued. The Samians on their voyage reached\\nthe country of the Epizephyrian Locrians, at a time when the Zanclaeans\\nand their king Scythas were engaged in the siege of a Sicilian town\\nwhich they hoped to take. Anaxilaus, tyrant of Rhegium, who was on\\nill terms with the Zanclaeans knowing how matters stood, made application\\nto the Samians, and persuaded them to give up the thought of Kale-Acte\\nthe place to which they were bound, and to seize Zancle itself, which\\nwas left without men. The Samians followed this counsel and possessed\\nthemselves of the town; which the Zanclaeans no sooner heard than\\nthey hurried to the rescue, calling to their aid Hippocrates, tyrant\\nof Gela, who was one of their allies. Hippocrates came with his army\\nto their assistance; but on his arrival he seized Scythas, the Zanclaean\\nking, who had just lost his city, and sent him away in chains, together\\nwith his brother Pythogenes, to the town of Inycus; after which he\\ncame to an understanding with the Samians, exchanged oaths with them,\\nand agreed to betray the people of Zancle. The reward of his treachery\\nwas to be one-half of the goods and chattels, including slaves, which\\nthe town contained, and all that he could find in the open country.\\nUpon this Hippocrates seized and bound the greater number of the Zanclaeans\\nas slaves; delivering, however, into the hands of the Samians three\\nhundred of the principal citizens, to be slaughtered; but the Samians\\nspared the lives of these persons. \\n\\nScythas, the king of the Zanclaeans, made his escape from Inycus,\\nand fled to Himera; whence he passed into Asia, and went up to the\\ncourt of Darius. Darius thought him the most upright of all the Greeks\\nto whom he afforded a refuge; for with the king\\'s leave he paid a\\nvisit to Sicily, and thence returned back to Persia, where he lived\\nin great comfort, and died by a natural death at an advanced age.\\n\\nThus did the Samians escape the yoke of the Medes, and possess themselves\\nwithout any trouble of Zancle, a most beautiful city. At Samos itself\\nthe Phoenicians, after the fight which had Miletus for its prize was\\nover, re-established Aeaces, the son of Syloson, upon his throne.\\nThis they did by the command of the Persians, who looked upon Aeaces\\nas one who had rendered them a high service and therefore deserved\\nwell at their hands. They likewise spared the Samians, on account\\nof the desertion of their vessels, and did not burn either their city\\nor their temples, as they did those of the other rebels. Immediately\\nafter the fall of Miletus the Persians recovered Caria, bringing some\\nof the cities over by force, while others submitted of their own accord.\\n\\nMeanwhile tidings of what had befallen Miletus reached Histiaeus the\\nMilesian, who was still at Byzantium, employed in intercepting the\\nIonian merchantmen as they issued from the Euxine. Histiaeus had no\\nsooner heard the news than he gave the Hellespont in charge to Bisaltes,\\nson of Apollophanes, a native of Abydos, and himself, at the head\\nof his Lesbians, set sail for Chios. One of the Chian garrisons which\\nopposed him he engaged at a place called \"The Hollows,\" situated in\\nthe Chian territory, and of these he slaughtered a vast number; afterwards,\\nby the help of his Lesbians, he reduced all the rest of the Chians,\\nwho were weakened by their losses in the sea-fight, Polichne, a city\\nof Chios, serving him as head-quarters. \\n\\nIt mostly happens that there is some warning when great misfortunes\\nare about to befall a state or nation; and so it was in this instance,\\nfor the Chians had previously had some strange tokens sent to them.\\nA choir of a hundred of their youths had been despatched to Delphi;\\nand of these only two had returned; the remaining ninety-eight having\\nbeen carried off by a pestilence. Likewise, about the same time, and\\nvery shortly before the sea-fight, the roof of a school-house had\\nfallen in upon a number of their boys, who were at lessons; and out\\nof a hundred and twenty children there was but one left alive. Such\\nwere the signs which God sent to warn them. It was very shortly afterwards\\nthat the sea-fight happened, which brought the city down upon its\\nknees; and after the sea-fight came the attack of Histiaeus and his\\nLesbians, to whom the Chians, weakened as they were, furnished an\\neasy conquest. \\n\\nHistiaeus now led a numerous army, composed of Ionians and Aelians,\\nagainst Thasos, and had laid siege to the place when news arrived\\nthat the Phoenicians were about to quit Miletus and attack the other\\ncities of Ionia. On hearing this, Histiaeus raised the siege of Thasos,\\nand hastened to Lesbos with all his forces. There his army was in\\ngreat straits for want of food; whereupon Histiaeus left Lesbos and\\nwent across to the mainland, intending to cut the crops which were\\ngrowing in the Atarnean territory, and likewise in the plain of the\\nCaicus, which belonged to Mysia. Now it chanced that a certain Persian\\nnamed Harpagus was in these regions at the head of an army of no little\\nstrength. He, when Histiaeus landed, marched out to meet him, and\\nengaging with his forces destroyed the greater number of them, and\\ntook Histiaeus himself prisoner. \\n\\nHistiaeus fell into the hands of the Persians in the following manner.\\nThe Greeks and Persians engaged at Malena, in the region of Atarneus;\\nand the battle was for a long time stoutly contested, till at length\\nthe cavalry came up, and, charging the Greeks, decided the conflict.\\nThe Greeks fled; and Histiaeus, who thought that Darius would not\\npunish his fault with death, showed how he loved his life by the following\\nconduct. Overtaken in his flight by one of the Persians, who was about\\nto run him through, he cried aloud in the Persian tongue that he was\\nHistiaeus the Milesian. \\n\\nNow, had he been taken straightway before King Darius, I verily believe\\nthat he would have received no hurt, but the king would have freely\\nforgiven him. Artaphernes, however, satrap of Sardis, and his captor\\nHarpagus, on this very account- because they were afraid that, if\\nhe escaped, he would be again received into high favour by the king-\\nput him to death as soon as he arrived at Sardis. His body they impaled\\nat that place, while they embalmed his head and sent it up to Susa\\nto the king. Darius, when he learnt what had taken place, found great\\nfault with the men engaged in this business for not bringing Histiaeus\\nalive into his presence, and commanded his servants to wash and dress\\nthe head with all care, and then bury it, as the head of a man who\\nhad been a great benefactor to himself and the Persians. Such was\\nthe sequel of the history of Histiaeus. \\n\\nThe naval armament of the Persians wintered at Miletus, and in the\\nfollowing year proceeded to attack the islands off the coast, Chios,\\nLesbos, and Tenedos, which were reduced without difficulty. Whenever\\nthey became masters of an island, the barbarians, in every single\\ninstance, netted the inhabitants. Now the mode in which they practise\\nthis netting is the following. Men join hands, so as to form a line\\nacross from the north coast to the south, and then march through the\\nisland from end to end and hunt out the inhabitants. In like manner\\nthe Persians took also the Ionian towns upon the mainland, not however\\nnetting the inhabitants, as it was not possible. \\n\\nAnd now their generals made good all the threats wherewith they had\\nmenaced the Ionians before the battle. For no sooner did they get\\npossession of the towns than they choose out all the best favoured\\nboys and made them eunuchs, while the most beautiful of the girls\\nthey tore from their homes and sent as presents to the king, at the\\nsame time burning the cities themselves, with their temples. Thus\\nwere the Ionians for the third time reduced to slavery; once by the\\nLydians, and a second, and now a third time, by the Persians.\\n\\nThe sea force, after quitting Ionia, proceeded to the Hellespont,\\nand took all the towns which lie on the left shore as one sails into\\nthe straits. For the cities on the right bank had already been reduced\\nby the land force of the Persians. Now these are the places which\\nborder the Hellespont on the European side; the Chersonese, which\\ncontains a number of cities, Perinthus, the forts in Thrace, Selybria,\\nand Byzantium. The Byzantines at this time, and their opposite neighbours,\\nthe Chalcedonians, instead of awaiting the coming of the Phoenicians,\\nquitted their country, and sailing into the Euxine, took up their\\nabode at the city of Mesembria. The Phoenicians, after burning all\\nthe places above mentioned, proceeded to Proconnresus and Artaca,\\nwhich they likewise delivered to the flames; this done, they returned\\nto the Chersonese, being minded to reduce those cities which they\\nhad not ravaged in their former cruise. Upon Cyzicus they made no\\nattack at all, as before their coming the inhabitants had made terms\\nwith Oebares, the son of Megabazus, and satrap of Dascyleium, and\\nhad submitted themselves to the king. In the Chersonese the Phoenicians\\nsubdued all the cities, excepting Cardia. \\n\\nUp to this time the cities of the Chersonese had been under the government\\nof Miltiades, the son of Cimon, and grandson of Stesagoras, to whom\\nthey had descended from Miltiades, the son of Cypselus, who obtained\\npossession of them in the following manner. The Dolonci, a Thracian\\ntribe, to whom the Chersonese at that time belonged, being harassed\\nby a war in which they were engaged with the Apsinthians, sent their\\nprinces to Delphi to consult the oracle about the matter. The reply\\nof the Pythoness bade them \"take back with them as a colonist into\\ntheir country the man who should first offer them hospitality after\\nthey quitted the temple.\" The Dolonci, following the Sacred Road,\\npassed through the regions of Phocis and Boeotia; after which, as\\nstill no one invited them in, they turned aside, and travelled to\\nAthens. \\n\\nNow Pisistratus was at this time sole lord of Athens; but Miltiades,\\nthe son of Cypselus, was likewise a person of much distinction. He\\nbelonged to a family which was wont to contend in the four-horse-chariot\\nraces, and traced its descent to Aeacus and Egina, but which, from\\nthe time of Philaeas, the son of Ajax, who was the first Athenian\\ncitizen of the house, had been naturalised at Athens. It happened\\nthat as the Dolonci passed his door Miltiades was sitting in his vestibule,\\nwhich caused him to remark them, dressed as they were in outlandish\\ngarments, and armed moreover with lances. He therefore called to them,\\nand, on their approach, invited them in, offering them lodging and\\nentertainment. The strangers accepted his hospitality, and, after\\nthe banquet was over, they laid before him in full the directions\\nof the oracle and besought him on their own part to yield obedience\\nto the god. Miltiades was persuaded ere they had done speaking; for\\nthe government of Pisistratus was irksome to him, and he wanted to\\nbe beyond the tyrant\\'s reach. He therefore went straightway to Delphi,\\nand inquired of the oracle whether he should do as the Dolonci desired.\\n\\nAs the Pythoness backed their request, Miltiades, son of Cypselus\\nwho had already won the four-horse chariot-race at Olympia, left Athens,\\ntaking with him as many of the Athenians as liked to join in the enterprise,\\nand sailed away with the Dolonci. On his arrival at the Chersonese,\\nhe was made king by those who had invited him. After this his first\\nact was to build a wall across the neck of the Chersonese from the\\ncity of Cardia to Pactya, to protect the country from the incursions\\nand ravages of the Apsinthians. The breadth of the isthmus at this\\npart is thirty-six furlongs, the whole length of the peninsula within\\nthe isthmus being four hundred and twenty furlongs. \\n\\nWhen he had finished carrying the wall across the isthmus, and had\\nthus secured the Chersonese against the Apsinthians, Miltiades proceeded\\nto engage in other wars, and first of all attacked the Lampsacenians;\\nbut falling into an ambush which they had laid he had the misfortune\\nto be taken prisoner. Now it happened that Miltiades stood high in\\nthe favour of Croesus, king of Lydia. When Croesus therefore heard\\nof his calamity, he sent and commanded the men of Lampsacus to give\\nMiltiades his freedom; \"if they refused,\" he said, \"he would destroy\\nthem like a fir.\" Then the Lampsacenians were somewhile in doubt about\\nthis speech of Croesus, and could not tell how to construe his threat\\n\"that he would destroy them like a fir\"; but at last one of their\\nelders divined the true sense, and told them that the fir is the only\\ntree which, when cut down, makes no fresh shoots, but forthwith dies\\noutright. So the Lampsacenians, being greatly afraid of Croesus, released\\nMiltiades, and let him go free. \\n\\nThus did Miltiades, by the help of Croesus, escape this danger. Some\\ntime afterwards he died childless, leaving his kingdom and his riches\\nto Stesagoras, who was the son of Cimon, his half-brother. Ever since\\nhis death the people of the Chersonese have offered him the customary\\nsacrifices of a founder; and they have further established in his\\nhonour a gymnic contest and a chariot-race, in neither of which is\\nit lawful for any Lampsacenian to contend. Before the war with Lampsacus\\nwas ended Stesagoras too died childless: he was sitting in the hall\\nof justice when he was struck upon the head with a hatchet by a man\\nwho pretended to be a deserter, but was in good sooth an enemy, and\\na bitter one. \\n\\nThus died Stesagoras; and upon his death the Pisistratidae fitted\\nout a trireme, and sent Miltiades, the son of Cimon, and brother of\\nthe deceased, to the Chersonese, that he might undertake the management\\nof affairs in that quarter. They had already shown him much favour\\nat Athens, as if, forsooth, they had been no parties to the death\\nof his father Cimon- a matter whereof I will give an account in another\\nplace. He upon his arrival remained shut up within the house, pretending\\nto do honour to the memory of his dead brother; whereupon the chief\\npeople of the Chersonese gathered themselves together from all the\\ncities of the land, and came in a procession to the place where Miltiades\\nwas, to condole with him upon his misfortune. Miltiades commanded\\nthem to be seized and thrown into prison; after which he made himself\\nmaster of the Chersonese, maintained a body of five hundred mercenaries,\\nand married Hegesipyla, daughter of the Thracian king Olorus.\\n\\nThis Miltiades, the son of Cimon, had not been long in the country\\nwhen a calamity befell him yet more grievous than those in which he\\nwas now involved: for three years earlier he had had to fly before\\nan incursion of the Scyths. These nomads, angered by the attack of\\nDarius, collected in a body and marched as far as the Chersonese.\\nMiltiades did not await their coming, but fled, and remained away\\nuntil the Scyths retired, when the Dolonci sent and fetched him back.\\nAll this happened three years before the events which befell Miltiades\\nat the present time. \\n\\nHe now no sooner heard that the Phoenicians were attacking Tenedos\\nthan he loaded five triremes with his goods and chattels, and set\\nsail for Athens. Cardia was the point from which he took his departure;\\nand as he sailed down the gulf of Melas, along the shore of the Chersonese,\\nhe came suddenly upon the whole Phoenician fleet. However he himself\\nescaped, with four of his vessels, and got into Imbrus, one trireme\\nonly falling into the hands of his pursuers. This vessel was under\\nthe command of his eldest son Metiochus, whose mother was not the\\ndaughter of the Thracian king Olorus, but a different woman. Metiochus\\nand his ship were taken; and when the Phoenicians found out that he\\nwas a son of Miltiades they resolved to convey him to the king, expecting\\nthereby to rise high in the royal favour. For they remembered that\\nit was Miltiades who counselled the Ionians to hearken when the Scyths\\nprayed them to break up the bridge and return home. Darius, however,\\nwhen the Phoenicians brought Metiochus into his presence, was so far\\nfrom doing him any hurt, that he loaded him with benefits. He gave\\nhim a house and estate, and also a Persian wife, by whom there were\\nchildren born to him who were accounted Persians. As for Miltiades\\nhimself, from Imbrus he made his way in safety to Athens.\\n\\nAt this time the Persians did no more hurt to the Ionians; but on\\nthe contrary, before the year was out, they carried into effect the\\nfollowing measures, which were greatly to their advantage. Artaphernes,\\nsatrap of Sardis, summoned deputies from all the Ionian cities, and\\nforced them to enter into agreements with one another, not to harass\\neach other by force of arms, but to settle their disputes by reference.\\nHe likewise took the measurement of their whole country in parasangs-\\nsuch is the name which the Persians give to a distance of thirty furlongs-\\nand settled the tributes which the several cities were to pay, at\\na rate that has continued unaltered from the time when Artaphernes\\nfixed it down to the present day. The rate was very nearly the same\\nas that which had been paid before the revolt. Such were the peaceful\\ndealings of the Persians with the Ionians. \\n\\nThe next spring Darius superseded all the other generals, and sent\\ndown Mardonius, the son of Gobryas, to the coast, and with him a vast\\nbody of men, some fit for sea, others for land service. Mardonius\\nwas a youth at this time, and had only lately married Artazostra,\\nthe king\\'s daughter. When Mardonius, accompanied by this numerous\\nhost, reached Cilicia, he took ship and proceeded along shore with\\nhis fleet, while the land army marched under other leaders towards\\nthe Hellespont. In the course of his voyage along the coast of Asia\\nhe came to Ionia; and here I have a marvel to relate which will greatly\\nsurprise those Greeks who cannot believe that Otanes advised the seven\\nconspirators to make Persia a commonwealth. Mardonius put down all\\nthe despots throughout Ionia, and in lieu of them established democracies.\\nHaving so done, he hastened to the Hellespont, and when a vast multitude\\nof ships had been brought together, and likewise a powerful land force,\\nhe conveyed his troops across the strait by means of his vessels,\\nand proceeded through Europe against Eretria and Athens.\\n\\nAt least these towns served as a pretext for the expedition, the real\\npurpose of which was to subjugate as great a number as possible of\\nthe Grecian cities; and this became plain when the Thasians, who did\\nnot even lift a hand in their defence, were reduced by the sea force,\\nwhile the land army added the Macedonians to the former slaves of\\nthe king. All the tribes on the hither side of Macedonia had been\\nreduced previously. From Thasos the fleet stood across to the mainland,\\nand sailed along shore to Acanthus, whence an attempt was made to\\ndouble Mount Athos. But here a violent north wind sprang up, against\\nwhich nothing could contend, and handled a large number of the ships\\nwith much rudeness, shattering them and driving them aground upon\\nAthos. \\'Tis said the number of the ships destroyed was little short\\nof three hundred; and the men who perished were more than twenty thousand.\\nFor the sea about Athos abounds in monsters beyond all others; and\\nso a portion were seized and devoured by these animals, while others\\nwere dashed violently against the rocks; some, who did not know how\\nto swim, were engulfed; and some died of the cold. \\n\\nWhile thus it fared with the fleet, on land Mardonius and his army\\nwere attacked in their camp during the night by the Brygi, a tribe\\nof Thracians; and here vast numbers of the Persians were slain, and\\neven Mardonius himself received a wound. The Brygi, nevertheless,\\ndid not succeed in maintaining their own freedom: for Mardonius would\\nnot leave the country till he had subdued them and made them subjects\\nof Persia. Still, though he brought them under the yoke, the blow\\nwhich his land force had received at their hands, and the great damage\\ndone to his fleet off Athos, induced him to set out upon his retreat;\\nand so this armament, having failed disgracefully, returned to Asia.\\n\\nThe year after these events, Darius received information from certain\\nneighbours of the Thasians that those islanders were making preparations\\nfor revolt; he therefore sent a herald, and bade them dismantle their\\nwalls, and bring all their ships to Abdera. The Thasians, at the time\\nwhen Histiaeus the Milesian made his attack upon them, had resolved\\nthat, as their income was very great, they would apply their wealth\\nto building ships of war, and surrounding their city with another\\nand a stronger wall. Their revenue was derived partly from their possessions\\nupon the mainland, partly from the mines which they owned. They were\\nmasters of the gold mines at Scapte-Hyle, the yearly produce of which\\namounted in all to eighty talents. Their mines in Thasos yielded less,\\nbut still were so far prolific that, besides being entirely free from\\nland-tax, they had a surplus income, derived from the two sources\\nof their territory on the main and their mines, in common years of\\ntwo hundred, and in the best years of three hundred talents.\\n\\nI myself have seen the mines in question: by far the most curious\\nof them are those which the Phoenicians discovered at the time when\\nthey went with Thasus and colonised the island, which afterwards took\\nits name from him. These Phoenician workings are in Thasos itself,\\nbetween Coenyra and a place called Aenyra, over against Samothrace:\\na huge mountain has been turned upside down in the search for ores.\\nSuch then was the source of their wealth. On this occasion no sooner\\ndid the Great King issue his commands than straightway the Thasians\\ndismantled their wall, and took their whole fleet to Abdera.\\n\\nAfter this Darius resolved to prove the Greeks, and try the bent of\\ntheir minds, whether they were inclined to resist him in arms or prepared\\nto make their submission. He therefore sent out heralds in divers\\ndirections round about Greece, with orders to demand everywhere earth\\nand water for the king. At the same time he sent other heralds to\\nthe various seaport towns which paid him tribute, and required them\\nto provide a number of ships of war and horse-transports.\\n\\nThese towns accordingly began their preparations; and the heralds\\nwho had been sent into Greece obtained what the king had bid them\\nask from a large number of the states upon the mainland, and likewise\\nfrom all the islanders whom they visited. Among these last were included\\nthe Eginetans, who, equally with the rest, consented to give earth\\nand water to the Persian king. \\n\\nWhen the Athenians heard what the Eginetans had done, believing that\\nit was from enmity to themselves that they had given consent, and\\nthat the Eginetans intended to join the Persian in his attack upon\\nAthens, they straightway took the matter in hand. In good truth it\\ngreatly rejoiced them to have so fair a pretext; and accordingly they\\nsent frequent embassies to Sparta, and made it a charge against the\\nEginetans that their conduct in this matter proved them to be traitors\\nto Greece. \\n\\nHereupon Cleomenes, the son of Anaxandridas, who was then king of\\nthe Spartans, went in person to Egina, intending to seize those whose\\nguilt was the greatest. As soon however as he tried to arrest them,\\na number of the Eginetins made resistance; a certain Crius, son of\\nPolycritus, being the foremost in violence. This person told him \"he\\nshould not carry off a single Eginetan without it costing him dear-\\nthe Athenians had bribed him to make this attack, for which he had\\nno warrant from his own government- otherwise both the kings would\\nhave come together to make the seizure.\" This he said in consequence\\nof instructions which he had received from Demaratus. Hereupon Cleomenes,\\nfinding that he must quit Egina, asked Crius his name; and when Crius\\ntold him, \"Get thy horns tipped with brass with all speed, O Crius!\"\\nhe said, \"for thou wilt have to struggle with a great danger.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile Demaratus, son of Ariston, was bringing charges against\\nCleomenes at Sparta. He too, like Cleomenes, was king of the Spartans,\\nbut he belonged to the lower house- not indeed that his house was\\nof any lower origin than the other, for both houses are of one blood-\\nbut the house of Eurysthenes is the more honoured of the two, inasmuch\\nas it is the elder branch. \\n\\nThe Lacedaemonians declare, contradicting therein all the poets, that\\nit was king Aristodemus himself, son of Aristomachus, grandson of\\nCleodaeus, and great-grandson of Hyllus, who conducted them to the\\nland which they now possess, and not the sons of Aristodemus. The\\nwife of Aristodemus, whose name (they say) was Argeia, and who was\\ndaughter of Autesion, son of Tisamenus, grandson of Thersander, and\\ngreat-grandson of Polynices, within a little while after their coming\\ninto the country, gave birth to twins. Aristodemus just lived to see\\nhis children, but died soon afterwards of a disease. The Lacedaemonians\\nof that day determined, according to custom, to take for their king\\nthe elder of the two children; but they were so alike, and so exactly\\nof one size, that they could not possibly tell which of the two to\\nchoose: so when they found themselves unable to make a choice, or\\nhaply even earlier, they went to the mother and asked her to tell\\nthem which was the elder, whereupon she declared that \"she herself\\ndid not know the children apart\"; although in good truth she knew\\nthem very well, and only feigned ignorance in order that, if it were\\npossible, both of them might be made kings of Sparta. The Lacedaemonians\\nwere now in a great strait; so they sent to Delphi and inquired of\\nthe oracle how they should deal with the matter. The Pythoness made\\nanswer, \"Let both be taken to be kings; but let the elder have the\\ngreater honour.\" So the Lacedaemonians were in as great a strait as\\nbefore, and could not conceive how they were to discover which was\\nthe first-born, till at length a certain Messenian, by name Panites,\\nsuggested to them to watch and see which of the two the mother washed\\nand fed first; if they found she always gave one the preference, that\\nfact would tell them all they wanted to know; if, on the contrary,\\nshe herself varied, and sometimes took the one first, sometimes the\\nother, it would be plain that she knew as little as they; in which\\ncase they must try some other plan. The Lacedaemonians did according\\nto the advice of the Messenian, and, without letting her know why,\\nkept a watch upon the mother; by which means they discovered that,\\nwhenever she either washed or fed her children, she always gave the\\nsame child the preference. So they took the boy whom the mother honoured\\nthe most, and regarding him as the first-born, brought him up in the\\npalace; and the name which they gave to the elder boy was Eurysthenes,\\nwhile his brother they called Procles. When the brothers grew up,\\nthere was always, so long as they lived, enmity between them; and\\nthe houses sprung from their loins have continued the feud to this\\nday. \\n\\nThus much is related by the Lacedaemonians, but not by any of the\\nother Greeks; in what follows I give the tradition of the Greeks generally.\\nThe kings of the Dorians (they say)- counting up to Perseus, son of\\nDanae, and so omitting the god- are rightly given in the common Greek\\nlists, and rightly considered to have been Greeks themselves; for\\neven at this early time they ranked among that people. I say \"up to\\nPerseus,\" and not further, because Perseus has no mortal father by\\nwhose name he is called, as Hercules has in Amphitryon; whereby it\\nappears that I have reason on my side, and am right in saying, \"up\\nto Perseus.\" If we follow the line of Danad, daughter of Acrisius,\\nand trace her progenitors, we shall find that the chiefs of the Dorians\\nare really genuine Egyptians. In the genealogies here given I have\\nfollowed the common Greek accounts. \\n\\nAccording to the Persian story, Perseus was an Assyrian who became\\na Greek; his ancestors, therefore, according to them, were not Greeks.\\nThey do not admit that the forefathers of Acrisius were in any way\\nrelated to Perseus, but say they were Egyptians, as the Greeks likewise\\ntestify. \\n\\nEnough however of this subject. How it came to pass that Egyptians\\nobtained the kingdoms of the Dorians, and what they did to raise themselves\\nto such a position, these are questions concerning which, as they\\nhave been treated by others, I shall say nothing. I proceed to speak\\nof points on which no other writer has touched. \\n\\nThe prerogatives which the Spartans have allowed their kings are the\\nfollowing. In the first place, two priesthoods, those (namely) of\\nLacedaemonian and of Celestial Jupiter; also the right of making war\\non what country soever they please, without hindrance from any of\\nthe other Spartans, under pain of outlawry; on service the privilege\\nof marching first in the advance and last in the retreat, and of having\\na hundred picked men for their body guard while with the army; likewise\\nthe liberty of sacrificing as many cattle in their expeditions as\\nit seems them good, and the right of having the skins and the chines\\nof the slaughtered animals for their own use. \\n\\nSuch are their privileges in war; in peace their rights are as follows.\\nWhen a citizen makes a public sacrifice the kings are given the first\\nseats at the banquet; they are served before any of the other guests,\\nand have a double portion of everything; they take the lead in the\\nlibations; and the hides of the sacrificed beasts belong to them.\\nEvery month, on the first day, and again on the seventh of the first\\ndecade, each king receives a beast without blemish at the public cost,\\nwhich he offers up to Apollo; likewise a medimnus of meal, and of\\nwine a Laconian quart. In the contests of the Games they have always\\nthe seat of honour; they appoint the citizens who have to entertain\\nforeigners; they also nominate, each of them, two of the Pythians,\\nofficers whose business it is to consult the oracle at Delphi, who\\neat with the kings, and, like them, live at the public charge. If\\nthe kings do not come to the public supper, each of them must have\\ntwo choenixes of meal and a cotyle of wine sent home to him at his\\nhouse; if they come, they are given a double quantity of each, and\\nthe same when any private man invites them to his table. They have\\nthe custody of all the oracles which are pronounced; but the Pythians\\nmust likewise have knowledge of them. They have the whole decision\\nof certain causes, which are these, and these only:- When a maiden\\nis left the heiress of her father\\'s estate, and has not been betrothed\\nby him to any one, they decide who is to marry her; in all matters\\nconcerning the public highways they judge; and if a person wants to\\nadopt a child, he must do it before the kings. They likewise have\\nthe right of sitting in council with the eight-and-twenty senators;\\nand if they are not present, then the senators nearest of kin to them\\nhave their privileges, and give two votes as the royal proxies, besides\\na third vote, which is their own. \\n\\nSuch are the honours which the Spartan people have allowed their kings\\nduring their lifetime; after they are dead other honours await them.\\nHorsemen carry the news of their death through all Laconia, while\\nin the city the women go hither and thither drumming upon a kettle.\\nAt this signal, in every house two free persons, a man and a woman,\\nmust put on mourning, or else be subject to a heavy fine. The Lacedaemonians\\nhave likewise a custom at the demise of their kings which is common\\nto them with the barbarians of Asia- indeed with the greater number\\nof the barbarians everywhere- namely, that when one of their kings\\ndies, not only the Spartans, but a certain number of the country people\\nfrom every part of Laconia are forced, whether they will or no, to\\nattend the funeral. So these persons and the helots, and likewise\\nthe Spartans themselves, flock together to the number of several thousands,\\nmen and women intermingled; and all of them smite their foreheads\\nviolently, and weep and wall without stint, saying always that their\\nlast king was the best. If a king dies in battle, then they make a\\nstatue of him, and placing it upon a couch right bravely decked, so\\ncarry it to the grave. After the burial, by the space of ten days\\nthere is no assembly, nor do they elect magistrates, but continue\\nmourning the whole time. \\n\\nThey hold with the Persians also in another custom. When a king dies,\\nand another comes to the throne, the newly-made monarch forgives all\\nthe Spartans the debts which they owe either to the king or to the\\npublic treasury. And in like manner among the Persians each king when\\nhe begins to reign remits the tribute due from the provinces.\\n\\nIn one respect the Lacedaemonians resemble the Egyptians. Their heralds\\nand flute-players, and likewise their cooks, take their trades by\\nsuccession from their fathers. A flute-player must be the son of a\\nflute-player, a cook of a cook, a herald of a herald; and other people\\ncannot take advantage of the loudness of their voice to come into\\nthe profession and shut out the heralds\\' sons; but each follows his\\nfather\\'s business. Such are the customs of the Lacedaemonians.\\n\\nAt the time of which we are speaking, while Cleomenes in Egina was\\nlabouring for the general good of Greece, Demaratus at Sparta continued\\nto bring charges against him, moved not so much by love of the Eginetans\\nas by jealousy and hatred of his colleague. Cleomenes therefore was\\nno sooner returned from Egina than he considered with himself how\\nhe might deprive Demaratus of his kingly office; and here the following\\ncircumstance furnished a ground for him to proceed upon. Ariston,\\nking of Sparta, had been married to two wives, but neither of them\\nhad borne him any children; as however he still thought it was possible\\nhe might have offspring, he resolved to wed a third; and this was\\nhow the wedding was brought about. He had a certain friend, a Spartan,\\nwith whom he was more intimate than with any other citizen. This friend\\nwas married to a wife whose beauty far surpassed that of all the other\\nwomen in Sparta; and what was still more strange, she had once been\\nas ugly as she now was beautiful. For her nurse, seeing how ill-favoured\\nshe was, and how sadly her parents, who were wealthy people, took\\nher bad looks to heart, bethought herself of a plan, which was to\\ncarry the child every day to the temple of Helen at Therapna, which\\nstands above the Phoebeum, and there to place her before the image,\\nand beseech the goddess to take away the child\\'s ugliness. One day,\\nas she left the temple, a woman appeared to her, and begged to know\\nwhat it was she held in her arms. The nurse told her it was a child,\\non which she asked to see it; but the nurse refused; the parents,\\nshe said, had forbidden her to show the child to any one. However\\nthe woman would not take a denial; and the nurse, seeing how highly\\nshe prized a look, at last let her see the child. Then the woman gently\\nstroked its head, and said, \"One day this child shall be the fairest\\ndame in Sparta.\" And her looks began to change from that very day.\\nWhen she was of marriageable age, Agetus, son of Alcides, the same\\nwhom I have mentioned above as the friend of Ariston, made her his\\nwife. \\n\\nNow it chanced that Ariston fell in love with this person; and his\\nlove so preyed upon his mind that at last he devised as follows. He\\nwent to his friend, the lady\\'s husband, and proposed to him that they\\nshould exchange gifts, each taking that which pleased him best out\\nof all the possessions of the other. His friend, who felt no alarm\\nabout his wife, since Ariston was also married, consented readily;\\nand so the matter was confirmed between them by an oath. Then Ariston\\ngave Agetus the present, whatever it was, of which he had made choice,\\nand when it came to his turn to name the present which he was to receive\\nin exchange, required to be allowed to carry home with him Agetus\\'s\\nwife. But the other demurred, and said, \"except his wife, he might\\nhave anything else\": however, as he could not resist the oath which\\nhe had sworn, or the trickery which had been practised on him, at\\nlast he suffered Ariston to carry her away to his house.\\n\\nAriston hereupon put away his second wife and took for his third this\\nwoman; and she, in less than the due time- when she had not yet reached\\nher full term of ten months- gave birth to a child, the Demaratus\\nof whom we have spoken. Then one of his servants came and told him\\nthe news, as he sat in council with the Ephors; whereat, remembering\\nwhen it was that the woman became his wife, he counted the months\\nupon his fingers, and having so done, cried out with an oath, \"The\\nboy cannot be mine.\" This was said in the hearing of the Ephors; but\\nthey made no account of it at the time. The boy grew up; and Ariston\\nrepented of what he had said; for he became altogether convinced that\\nDemaratus was truly his son. The reason why he named him Demaratus\\nwas the following. Some time before these events the whole Spartan\\npeople, looking upon Ariston as a man of mark beyond all the kings\\nthat had reigned at Sparta before him, had offered up a prayer that\\nhe might have a son. On this account, therefore, the name Demaratus\\nwas given. \\n\\nIn course of time Ariston died; and Demaratus received the kingdom:\\nbut it was fated, as it seems, that these words, when bruited abroad,\\nshould strip him of his sovereignty. This was brought about by means\\nof Cleomenes, whom he had twice sorely vexed, once when he led the\\narmy home from Eleusis, and a second time when Cleomenes was gone\\nacross to Egina against such as had espoused the side of the Medes.\\n\\nCleomenes now, being resolved to have his revenge upon Demaratus,\\nwent to Leotychides, the son of Menares, and grandson of Agis, who\\nwas of the same family as Demaratus, and made agreement with him to\\nthis tenor following. Cleomenes was to lend his aid to make Leotychides\\nking in the room of Demaratus; and then Leotychides was to take part\\nwith Cleomenes against the Eginetans. Now Leotychides hated Demaratus\\nchiefly on account of Percalus, the daughter of Chilon, son of Demarmenus:\\nthis lady had been betrothed to Leotychides; but Demaratus laid a\\nplot, and robbed him of his bride, forestalling him in carrying her\\noff, and marrying her. Such was the origin of the enmity. At the time\\nof which we speak, Leotychides was prevailed upon by the earnest desire\\nof Cleomenes to come forward against Demaratus and make oath \"that\\nDemaratus was not rightful king of Sparta, since he was not the true\\nson of Ariston.\" After he had thus sworn, Leotychides sued Demaratus,\\nand brought up against him the phrase which Ariston had let drop when,\\non the coming of his servant to announce to him the birth of his son,\\nhe counted the months, and cried out with an oath that the child was\\nnot his. It was on this speech of Ariston\\'s that Leotychides relied\\nto prove that Demaratus was not his son, and therefore not rightful\\nking of Sparta; and he produced as witnesses the Ephors who were sitting\\nwith Ariston at the time and heard what he said. \\n\\nAt last, as there came to be much strife concerning this matter, the\\nSpartans made a decree that the Delphic oracle should be asked to\\nsay whether Demaratus were Ariston\\'s son or no. Cleomenes set them\\nupon this plan; and no sooner was the decree passed than he made a\\nfriend of Cobon, the son of Aristophantus, a man of the greatest weight\\namong the Delphians; and this Cobon prevailed upon Perialla, the prophetess,\\nto give the answer which Cleomenes wished. Accordingly, when the sacred\\nmessengers came and put their question, the Pythoness returned for\\nanswer \"that Demaratus was not Ariston\\'s son.\" Some time afterwards\\nall this became known; and Cobon was forced to fly from Delphi; while\\nPerialla the prophetess was deprived of her office. \\n\\nSuch were the means whereby the deposition of Demaratus was brought\\nabout; but his flying from Sparta to the Medes was by reason of an\\naffront which was put upon him. On losing his kingdom he had been\\nmade a magistrate; and in that office soon afterwards, when the feast\\nof the Gymnopaediae came around, he took his station among the lookers-on;\\nwhereupon Leotychides, who was now king in his room, sent a servant\\nto him and asked him, by way of insult and mockery, \"how it felt to\\nbe a magistrate after one had been a king?\" Demaratus, who was hurt\\nat the question, made answer- \"Tell him I have tried them both, but\\nhe has not. Howbeit this speech will be the cause to Sparta of infinite\\nblessings or else of infinite woes.\" Having thus spoken he wrapped\\nhis head in his robe, and, leaving the theatre, went home to his own\\nhouse, where he prepared an ox for sacrifice, and offered it to Jupiter,\\nafter which he called for his mother. \\n\\nWhen she appeared, he took of the entrails, and placing them in her\\nhand, besought her in these words following:- \\n\\n\"Dear mother, I beseech you, by all the gods, and chiefly by our own\\nhearth-god Jupiter, tell me the very truth, who was really my father.\\nFor Leotychides, in the suit which we had together, declared that\\nwhen thou becamest Ariston\\'s wife thou didst already bear in thy womb\\na child by thy former husband, and others repeat a yet more disgraceful\\ntale, that our groom found favour in thine eyes, and that I am his\\nson. I entreat thee therefore by the gods to tell me the truth. For\\nif thou hast gone astray, thou hast done no more than many a woman;\\nand the Spartans remark it as strange, if I am Ariston\\'s son, that\\nhe had no children by his other wives.\" \\n\\nThus spake Demaratus; and his mother replied as follows: \"Dear son,\\nsince thou entreatest so earnestly for the truth, it shall indeed\\nbe fully told to thee. When Ariston brought me to his house, on the\\nthird night after my coming, there appeared to me one like to Ariston,\\nwho, after staying with me a while, rose, and taking the garlands\\nfrom his own brows placed them upon my head, and so went away. Presently\\nafter Ariston entered, and when he saw the garlands which I still\\nwore, asked me who gave them to me. I said, \\'twas he; but this he\\nstoutly denied; whereupon I solemnly swore that it was none other,\\nand told him he did not do well to dissemble when he had so lately\\nrisen from my side and left the garlands with me. Then Ariston, when\\nhe heard my oath, understood that there was something beyond nature\\nin what had taken place. And indeed it appeared that the garlands\\nhad come from the hero-temple which stands by our court gates- the\\ntemple of him they call Astrabacus- and the soothsayers, moreover,\\ndeclared that the apparition was that very person. And now, my son,\\nI have told thee all thou wouldest fain know. Either thou art the\\nson of that hero- either thou mayest call Astrabacus sire; or else\\nAriston was thy father. As for that matter which they who hate thee\\nurge the most, the words of Ariston, who, when the messenger told\\nhim of thy birth, declared before many witnesses that \\'thou wert not\\nhis son, forasmuch as the ten months were not fully out,\\' it was a\\nrandom speech, uttered from mere ignorance. The truth is, children\\nare born not only at ten months, but at nine, and even at seven. Thou\\nwert thyself, my son, a seven months\\' child. Ariston acknowledged,\\nno long time afterwards, that his speech sprang from thoughtlessness.\\nHearken not then to other tales concerning thy birth, my son: for\\nbe assured thou hast the whole truth. As for grooms, pray Heaven Leotychides\\nand all who speak as he does may suffer wrong from them!\" Such was\\nthe mother\\'s answer. \\n\\nDemaratus, having learnt all that he wished to know, took with him\\nprovision for the journey, and went into Elis, pretending that he\\npurposed to proceed to Delphi, and there consult the oracle. The Lacedaemonians,\\nhowever, suspecting that he meant to fly his country, sent men in\\npursuit of him; but Demaratus hastened, and leaving Elis before they\\narrived, sailed across to Zacynthus. The Lacedaemonians followed,\\nand sought to lay hands upon him, and to separate him from his retinue;\\nbut the Zacynthians would not give him up to them: so he escaping,\\nmade his way afterwards by sea to Asia, and presented himself before\\nKing Darius, who received him generously, and gave him both lands\\nand cities. Such was the chance which drove Demaratus to Asia, a man\\ndistinguished among the Lacedaemonians for many noble deeds and wise\\ncounsels, and who alone of all the Spartan kings brought honour to\\nhis country by winning at Olympia the prize in the four-horse chariot-race.\\n\\nAfter Demaratus was deposed, Leotychides, the son of Menares, received\\nthe kingdom. He had a son, Zeuxidamus, called Cyniscus by many of\\nthe Spartans. This Zeuxidamus did not reign at Sparta, but died before\\nhis father, leaving a son, Archidamus. Leotychides, when Zeuxidamus\\nwas taken from him, married a second wife, named Eurydame, the sister\\nof Menius and daughter of Diactorides. By her he had no male offspring,\\nbut only a daughter called Lampito, whom he gave in marriage to Archidamus,\\nZeuxidamus\\' son. \\n\\nEven Leotychides, however, did not spend his old age in Sparta, but\\nsuffered a punishment whereby Demaratus was fully avenged. He commanded\\nthe Lacedaemonians when they made war against Thessaly, and might\\nhave conquered the whole of it, but was bribed by a large sum of money.\\nIt chanced that he was caught in the fact, being found sitting in\\nhis tent on a gauntlet, quite full of silver. Upon this he was brought\\nto trial and banished from Sparta; his house was razed to the ground;\\nand he himself fled to Tegea, where he ended his days. But these events\\ntook place long afterwards. \\n\\nAt the time of which we are speaking, Cleomenes, having carried his\\nproceedings in the matter of Demaratus to a prosperous issue, forthwith\\ntook Leotychides with him, and crossed over to attack the Eginetans;\\nfor his anger was hot against them on account of the affront which\\nthey had formerly put upon him. Hereupon the Eginetans, seeing that\\nboth the kings were come against them, thought it best to make no\\nfurther resistance. So the two kings picked out from all Egina the\\nten men who for wealth and birth stood the highest, among whom were\\nCrius, son of Polycritus, and Casambus, son of Aristocrates, who wielded\\nthe chief power; and these men they carried with them to Attica, and\\nthere deposited them in the hands of the Athenians, the great enemies\\nof the Eginetans. \\n\\nAfterwards, when it came to be known what evil arts had been used\\nagainst Demaratus, Cleomenes was seized with fear of his own countrymen,\\nand fled into Thessaly. From thence he passed into Arcadia, where\\nhe began to stir up troubles, and endeavoured to unite the Arcadians\\nagainst Sparta. He bound them by various oaths to follow him whithersoever\\nhe should lead, and was even desirous of taking their chief leaders\\nwith him to the city of Nonacris, that he might swear them to his\\ncause by the waters of the Styx. For the waters of Styx, as the Arcadians\\nsay, are in that city, and this is the appearance they present: you\\nsee a little water, dripping from a rock into a basin, which is fenced\\nround by a low wall. Nonacris, where this fountain is to be seen,\\nis a city of Arcadia near Pheneus. \\n\\nWhen the Lacedaemonians heard how Cleomenes was engaged, they were\\nafraid, and agreed with him that he should come back to Sparta and\\nbe king as before. So Cleomenes came back; but had no sooner returned\\nthan he, who had never been altogether of sound mind, was smitten\\nwith downright madness. This he showed by striking every Spartan he\\nmet upon the face with his sceptre. On his behaving thus, and showing\\nthat he was gone quite out of his mind, his kindred imprisoned him,\\nand even put his feet in the stocks. While so bound, finding himself\\nleft alone with a single keeper, he asked the man for a knife. The\\nkeeper at first refused, whereupon Cleomenes began to threaten him,\\nuntil at last he was afraid, being only a helot, and gave him what\\nhe required. Cleomenes had no sooner got the steel than, beginning\\nat his legs, he horribly disfigured himself, cutting gashes in his\\nflesh, along his legs, thighs, hips, and loins, until at last he reached\\nhis belly, which he likewise began to gash, whereupon in a little\\ntime he died. The Greeks generally think that this fate came upon\\nhim because he induced the Pythoness to pronounce against Demaratus;\\nthe Athenians differ from all others in saying that it was because\\nhe cut down the sacred grove of the goddesses when he made his invasion\\nby Eleusis; while the Argives ascribe it to his having taken from\\ntheir refuge and cut to pieces certain argives who had fled from battle\\ninto a precinct sacred to Argus, where Cleomenes slew them, burning\\nlikewise at the same time, through irreverence, the grove itself.\\n\\nFor once, when Cleomenes had sent to Delphi to consult the oracle,\\nit was prophesied to him that he should take Argos; upon which he\\nwent out at the head of the Spartans, and led them to the river Erasinus.\\nThis stream is reported to flow from the Stymphalian lake, the waters\\nof which empty themselves into a pitch-dark chasm, and then (as they\\nsay) reappear in Argos, where the Argives call them the Erasinus.\\nCleomenes, having arrived upon the banks of this river, proceeded\\nto offer sacrifice to it, but, in spite of all that he could do, the\\nvictims were not favourable to his crossing. So he said that he admired\\nthe god for refusing to betray his countrymen, but still the Argives\\nshould not escape him for all that. He then withdrew his troops, and\\nled them down to Thyrea, where he sacrificed a bull to the sea, and\\nconveyed his men on shipboard to Nauplia in the Tirynthian territory.\\n\\nThe Argives, when they heard of this, marched down to the sea to defend\\ntheir country; and arriving in the neighbourhood of Tiryns, at the\\nplace which bears the name of Sepeia, they pitched their camp opposite\\nto the Lacedaemonians, leaving no great space between the hosts. And\\nnow their fear was not so much lest they should be worsted in open\\nfight as lest some trick should be practised on them; for such was\\nthe danger which the oracle given to them in common with the Milesians\\nseemed to intimate. The oracle ran as follows:- \\n\\nTime shall be when the female shall conquer the male, and shall chase\\nhim \\nFar away- gaining so great praise and honour in Argos; \\nThen full many an Argive woman her cheeks shall mangle \\nHence, in the times to come \\'twill be said by the men who are unborn,\\n\\n\"Tamed by the spear expired the coiled terrible serpent.\" At the coincidence\\nof all these things the Argives were greatly cast down; and so they\\nresolved that they would follow the signals of the enemy\\'s herald.\\nHaving made this resolve, they proceeded to act as follows: whenever\\nthe herald of the Lacedaemonians gave an order to the soldiers of\\nhis own army, the Argives did the like on their side. \\n\\nNow when Cleomenes heard that the Argives were acting thus, he commanded\\nhis troops that, so soon as the herald gave the word for the soldiers\\nto go to dinner, they should instantly seize their arms and charge\\nthe host of the enemy. Which the Lacedaemonians did accordingly, and\\nfell upon the Argives just as, following the signal, they had begun\\ntheir repast; whereby it came to pass that vast numbers of the Argives\\nwere slain, while the rest, who were more than they which died in\\nthe fight, were driven to take refuge in the grove of Argus hard by,\\nwhere they were surrounded, and watch kept upon them. \\n\\nWhen things were at this pass Cleomenes acted as follows: Having learnt\\nthe names of the Argives who were shut up in the sacred precinct from\\ncertain deserters who had come over to him, he sent a herald to summon\\nthem one by one, on pretence of having received their ransoms. Now\\nthe ransom of prisoners among the Peloponnesians is fixed at two minae\\nthe man. So Cleomenes had these persons called forth severally, to\\nthe number of fifty, or thereabouts, and massacred them. All this\\nwhile they who remained in the enclosure knew nothing of what was\\nhappening; for the grove was so thick that the people inside were\\nunable to see what was taking place without. But at last one of their\\nnumber climbed up into a tree and spied the treachery; after which\\nnone of those who were summoned would go forth. \\n\\nThen Cleomenes ordered all the helots to bring brushwood, and heap\\nit around the grove; which was done accordingly; and Cleomenes set\\nthe grove on fire. As the flames spread he asked a deserter \"Who was\\nthe god of the grove?\" whereto the other made answer, \"Argus.\" So\\nhe, when he heard that, uttered a loud groan, and said:-\\n\\n\"Greatly hast thou deceived me, Apollo, god of prophecy, in saying\\nthat I should take Argos. I fear me thy oracle has now got its accomplishment.\"\\n\\nCleomenes now sent home the greater part of his army, while with a\\nthousand of his best troops he proceeded to the temple of Juno, to\\noffer sacrifice. When however he would have slain the victim on the\\naltar himself, the priest forbade him, as it was not lawful (he said)\\nfor a foreigner to sacrifice in that temple. At this Cleomenes ordered\\nhis helots to drag the priest from the altar and scourge him, while\\nhe performed the sacrifice himself, after which he went back to Sparta.\\n\\nThereupon his enemies brought him up before the Ephors, and made it\\na charge against him that he had allowed himself to be bribed, and\\non that account had not taken Argos when he might have captured it\\neasily. To this he answered- whether truly or falsely I cannot say\\nwith certainty- but at any rate his answer to the charge was that\\n\"so soon as he discovered the sacred precinct which he had taken to\\nbelong to Argos, he directly imagined that the oracle had received\\nits accomplishment; he therefore thought it not good to attempt the\\ntown, at the least until he had inquired by sacrifice, and ascertained\\nif the god meant to grant him the place, or was determined to oppose\\nhis taking it. So he offered in the temple of Juno, and when the omens\\nwere propitious, immediately there flashed forth a flame of fire from\\nthe breast of the image; whereby he knew of a surety that he was not\\nto take Argos. For if the flash had come from the head, he would have\\ngained the town, citadel and all; but as it shone from the breast,\\nhe had done so much as the god intended.\" And his words seemed to\\nthe Spartans so true and reasonable, that he came clear off from his\\nadversaries. \\n\\nArgos however was left so bare of men that the slaves managed the\\nstate, filled the offices, and administered everything until the sons\\nof those who were slain by Cleomenes grew up. Then these latter cast\\nout the slaves, and got the city back under their own rule; while\\nthe slaves who had been driven out fought a battle and won Tiryns.\\nAfter this for a time there was peace between the two; but a certain\\nman, a soothsayer, named Cleander, who was by race a Phigalean from\\nArcadia, joined himself to the slaves, and stirred them up to make\\na fresh attack upon their lords. Then were they at war with one another\\nby the space of many years; but at length the Argives with much trouble\\ngained the upper hand. \\n\\nThe Argives say that Cleomenes lost his senses, and died so miserably,\\non account of these doings. But his own countrymen declare that his\\nmadness proceeded not from any supernatural cause whatever, but only\\nfrom the habit of drinking wine unmixed with water, which he learnt\\nof the Scyths. These nomads, from the time that Darius made his inroad\\ninto their country, had always had a wish for revenge. They therefore\\nsent ambassadors to Sparta to conclude a league, proposing to endeavour\\nthemselves to enter Media by the Phasis, while the Spartans should\\nmarch inland from Ephesus, and then the two armies should join together\\nin one. When the Scyths came to Sparta on this errand Cleomenes was\\nwith them continually; and growing somewhat too familiar, learnt of\\nthem to drink his wine without water, a practice which is thought\\nby the Spartans to have caused his madness. From this distance of\\ntime the Spartans, according to their own account, have been accustomed,\\nwhen they want to drink purer wine than common, to give the order\\nto fill \"Scythian fashion.\" The Spartans then speak thus concerning\\nCleomenes; but for my own part I think his death was a judgment on\\nhim for wronging Demaratus. \\n\\nNo sooner did the news of Cleomenes\\' death reach Egina than straightway\\nthe Eginetans sent ambassadors to Sparta to complain of the conduct\\nof Leotychides in respect of their hostages, who were still kept at\\nAthens. So they of Lacedaemon assembled a court of justice and gave\\nsentence upon Leotychides, that whereas he had grossly affronted the\\npeople of Egina, he should be given up to the ambassadors, to be led\\naway in place of the men whom the Athenians had in their keeping.\\nThen the ambassadors were about to lead him away; but Theasides, the\\nson of Leoprepes, who was a man greatly esteemed in Sparta, interfered,\\nand said to them:- \\n\\n\"What are ye minded to do, ye men of Egina? To lead away captive the\\nking of the Spartans, whom his countrymen have given into your hands?\\nThough now in their anger they have passed this sentence, yet belike\\nthe time will come when they will punish you, if you act thus, by\\nbringing utter destruction upon your country.\" \\n\\nThe Eginetans, when they heard this, changed their plan, and, instead\\nof leading Leotychides away captive, agreed with him that he should\\ncome with them to Athens, and give them back their men. \\n\\nWhen however he reached that city, and demanded the restoration of\\nhis pledge, the Athenians, being unwilling to comply, proceeded to\\nmake excuses, saying \"that two kings had come and left the men with\\nthem, and they did not think it right to give them back to the one\\nwithout the other.\" So when the Athenians refused plainly to restore\\nthe men, Leotychides said to them:- \\n\\n\"Men of Athens, act which way you choose- give me up the hostages,\\nand be righteous, or keep them, and be the contrary. I wish, however,\\nto tell you what happened once in Sparta about a pledge. The story\\ngoes among us that three generations back there lived in Lacedaemon\\none Glaucus, the son of Epicydes, a man who in every other respect\\nwas on a par with the first in the kingdom, and whose character for\\njustice was such as to place him above all the other Spartans. Now\\nto this man at the appointed season the following events happened.\\nA certain Milesian came to Sparta and, having desired to speak with\\nhim, said- \\'I am of Miletus, and I have come hither, Glaucus, in the\\nhope of profiting by thy honesty. For when I heard much talk thereof\\nin Ionia and through all the rest of Greece, and when I observed that\\nwhereas Ionia is always insecure, the Peloponnese stands firm and\\nunshaken, and noted likewise how wealth is continually changing hands\\nin our country, I took counsel with myself and resolved to turn one-half\\nof my substance into money, and place it in thy hands, since I am\\nwell assured that it will be safe in thy keeping. Here then is the\\nsilver- take it- and take likewise these tallies, and be careful of\\nthem; remember thou art to give back the money to the person who shall\\nbring you their fellows.\\' Such were the words of the Milesian stranger;\\nand Glaucus took the deposit on the terms expressed to him. Many years\\nhad gone by when the sons of the man by whom the money was left came\\nto Sparta, and had an interview with Glaucus, whereat they produced\\nthe tallies, and asked to have the money returned to them. But Glaucus\\nsought to refuse, and answered them: \\'I have no recollection of the\\nmatter; nor can I bring to mind any of those particulars whereof ye\\nspeak. When I remember, I will certainly do what is just. If I had\\nthe money, you have a right to receive it back; but if it was never\\ngiven to me, I shall put the Greek law in force against you. For the\\npresent I give you no answer; but four months hence I will settle\\nthe business.\\' So the Milesians went away sorrowful, considering that\\ntheir money was utterly lost to them. As for Glaucus, he made a journey\\nto Delphi, and there consulted the oracle. To his question if he should\\nswear, and so make prize of the money, the Pythoness returned for\\nanswer these lines following:- \\n\\nBest for the present it were, O Glaucus, to do as thou wishest,\\n\\nSwearing an oath to prevail, and so to make prize of the money.\\n\\nSwear then- death is the lot e\\'en of those who never swear falsely.\\n\\nYet hath the Oath-God a son who is nameless, footless, and handless;\\n\\nMighty in strength he approaches to vengeance, and whelms in destruction,\\n\\nAll who belong to the race, or the house of the man who is perjured.\\n\\nBut oath- keeping men leave behind them a flourishing offspring. Glaucus\\nwhen he heard these words earnestly besought the god to pardon his\\nquestion; but the Pythoness replied that it was as bad to have tempted\\nthe god as it would have been to have done the deed. Glaucus, however,\\nsent for the Milesian strangers, and gave them back their money. And\\nnow I will tell you, Athenians, what my purpose has been in recounting\\nto you this history. Glaucus at the present time has not a single\\ndescendant; nor is there any family known as his- root and branch\\nhas he been removed from Sparta. It is a good thing, therefore, when\\na pledge has been left with one, not even in thought to doubt about\\nrestoring it.\" \\n\\nThus spake Leotychides; but, as he found that the Athenians would\\nnot hearken to him, he left them and went his way. \\n\\nThe Eginetans had never been punished for the wrongs which, to pleasure\\nthe Thebans, they had committed upon Athens. Now, however, conceiving\\nthat they were themselves wronged, and had a fair ground of complaint\\nagainst the Athenians, they instantly prepared to revenge themselves.\\nAs it chanced that the Athenian theoris, which was a vessel of five\\nbanks of oars, lay at Sunium, the Eginetans contrived an ambush, and\\nmade themselves masters of the holy vessel, on board of which were\\na number of Athenians of the highest rank, whom they took and threw\\ninto prison. \\n\\nAt this outrage the Athenians no longer delayed, but set to work to\\nscheme their worst against the Eginetans; and, as there was in Egina\\nat that time a man of mark, Nicodromus by name, the son of Cnoethus,\\nwho was on ill terms with his countrymen because on a former occasion\\nthey had driven him into banishment, they listened to overtures from\\nthis man, who had heard how determined they were to do the Eginetans\\na mischief, and agreed with him that on a certain day he should be\\nready to betray the island into their hands, and they would come with\\na body of troops to his assistance. And Nicodromus, some time after,\\nholding to the agreement, made himself master of what is called the\\nold town. \\n\\nThe Athenians, however, did not come to the day; for their own fleet\\nwas not of force sufficient to engage the Eginetans, and while they\\nwere begging the Corinthians to lend them some ships, the failure\\nof the enterprise took place. In those days the Corinthians were on\\nthe best of terms with the Athenians; and accordingly they now yielded\\nto their request, and furnished them with twenty ships; but, as their\\nlaw did not allow the ships to be given for nothing, they sold them\\nto the Athenians for five drachms apiece. As soon then as the Athenians\\nhad obtained this aid, and, by manning also their own ships, had equipped\\na fleet of seventy sail, they crossed over to Egina, but arrived a\\nday later than the time agreed upon. \\n\\nMeanwhile Nicodromus, when he found the Athenians did not come to\\nthe time appointed, took ship and made his escape from the island.\\nThe Eginetans who accompanied him were settled by the Athenians at\\nSunium, whence they were wont to issue forth and plunder the Eginetans\\nof the island. But this took place at a later date. \\n\\nWhen the wealthier Eginetans had thus obtained the victory over the\\ncommon people who had revolted with Nicodromus, they laid hands on\\na certain number of them, and led them out to death. But here they\\nwere guilty of a sacrilege, which, notwithstanding all their efforts,\\nthey were never able to atone, being driven from the island before\\nthey had appeased the goddess whom they now provoked. Seven hundred\\nof the common people had fallen alive into their hands; and they were\\nall being led out to death, when one of them escaped from his chains,\\nand flying to the gateway of the temple of Ceres the Lawgiver, laid\\nhold of the doorhandles, and clung to them. The others sought to drag\\nhim from his refuge; but, finding themselves unable to tear him away,\\nthey cut off his hands, and so took him, leaving the hands still tightly\\ngrasping the handles. \\n\\nSuch were the doings of the Eginetans among themselves. When the Athenians\\narrived, they went out to meet them with seventy ships; and a battle\\ntook place, wherein the Eginetans suffered a defeat. Hereupon they\\nhad recourse again to their old allies, the Argives; but these latter\\nrefused now to lend them any aid, being angry because some Eginetan\\nships, which Cleomenes had taken by force, accompanied him in his\\ninvasion of Argolis, and joined in the disembarkation. The same thing\\nhad happened at the same time With certain vessels of the Sicyonians;\\nand the Argives had laid a fine of a thousand talents upon the misdoers,\\nfive hundred upon each: whereupon they of Sicyon acknowledged themselves\\nto have sinned, and agreed with the Argives to pay them a hundred\\ntalents, and so be quit of the debt; but the Eginetans would make\\nno acknowledgment at all, and showed themselves proud and stiffnecked.\\nFor this reason, when they now prayed the Argives for aid, the state\\nrefused to send them a single soldier. Notwithstanding, volunteers\\njoined them from Argos to the number of a thousand, under a captain,\\nEurybates, a man skilled in the pentathlic contests. Of these men\\nthe greater part never returned, but were slain by the Athenians in\\nEgina. Eurybates, their captain, fought a number of single combats,\\nand, after killing three men in this way, was himself slain by the\\nfourth, who was a Decelean, named Sophanes. \\n\\nAfterwards the Eginetans fell upon the Athenian fleet when it was\\nin some disorder and beat it, capturing four ships with their crews.\\n\\nThus did war rage between the Eginetans and Athenians. Meantime the\\nPersian pursued his own design, from day to day exhorted by his servant\\nto \"remember the Athenians,\" and likewise urged continually by the\\nPisistratidae, who were ever accusing their countrymen. Moreover it\\npleased him well to have a pretext for carrying war into Greece, that\\nso he might reduce all those who had refused to give him earth and\\nwater. As for Mardonius, since his expedition had succeeded so ill,\\nDarius took the command of the troops from him, and appointed other\\ngenerals in his stead, who were to lead the host against Eretria and\\nAthens; to wit, Datis, who was by descent a Mede, and Artaphernes,\\nthe son of Artaphernes, his own nephew. These men received orders\\nto carry Athens and Eretria away captive, and to bring the prisoners\\ninto his presence. \\n\\nSo the new commanders took their departure from the court and went\\ndown to Cilicia, to the Aleian plain, having with them a numerous\\nand wellappointed land army. Encamping here, they were joined by the\\nsea force which had been required of the several states, and at the\\nsame time by the horsetransports which Darius had, the year before,\\ncommanded his tributaries to make ready. Aboard these the horses were\\nembarked; and the troops were received by the ships of war; after\\nwhich the whole fleet, amounting in all to six hundred triremes, made\\nsail for Ionia. Thence, instead of proceeding with a straight course\\nalong the shore to the Hellespont and to Thrace, they loosed from\\nSamos and voyaged across the Icarian sea through the midst of the\\nislands; mainly, as I believe, because they feared the danger of doubling\\nMount Athos, where the year before they had suffered so grievously\\non their passage; but a constraining cause also was their former failure\\nto take Naxos. \\n\\nWhen the Persians, therefore, approaching from the Icarian Sea, cast\\nanchor at Naxos, which, recollecting what there befell them formerly,\\nthey had determined to attack before any other state, the Naxians,\\ninstead of encountering them, took to flight, and hurried off to the\\nhills. The Persians however succeeded in laying hands on some, and\\nthem they carried away captive, while at the same time they burnt\\nall the temples together with the town. This done, they left Naxos,\\nand sailed away to the other islands. \\n\\nWhile the Persians were thus employed, the Delians likewise quitted\\nDelos, and took refuge in Tenos. And now the expedition drew near,\\nwhen Datis sailed forward in advance of the other ships; commanding\\nthem, instead of anchoring at Delos, to rendezvous at Rhenea, over\\nagainst Delos, while he himself proceeded to discover whither the\\nDelians had fled; after which he sent a herald to them with this message:\\n\\n\"Why are ye fled, O holy men? Why have ye judged me so harshly and\\nso wrongfully? I have surely sense enough, even had not the king so\\nordered, to spare the country which gave birth to the two gods- to\\nspare, I say, both the country and its inhabitants. Come back therefore\\nto your dwellings; and once more inhabit your island.\" \\n\\nSuch was the message which Datis sent by his herald to the Delians.\\nHe likewise placed upon the altar three hundred talents\\' weight of\\nfrankincense, and offered it. \\n\\nAfter this he sailed with his whole host against Eretria, taking with\\nhim both Ionians and Aeolians. When he was departed, Delos (as the\\nDelians told me) was shaken by an earthquake, the first and last shock\\nthat has been felt to this day. And truly this was a prodigy whereby\\nthe god warned men of the evils that were coming upon them. For in\\nthe three following generations of Darius the son of Hystaspes, Xerxes\\nthe son of Darius, and Artaxerxes the son of Xerxes, more woes befell\\nGreece than in the twenty generations preceding Darius- woes caused\\nin part by the Persians, but in part arising from the contentions\\namong their own chief men respecting the supreme power. Wherefore\\nit is not surprising that Delos, though it had never before been shaken,\\nshould at that time have felt the shock of an earthquake. And indeed\\nthere was an oracle, which said of Delos- \\n\\nDelo\\'s self will I shake, which never yet has been shaken Of the above\\nnames Darius may be rendered \"Worker,\" Xerxes \"Warrior,\" and Artaxerxes\\n\"Great Warrior.\" And so might we call these kings in our own language\\nwith propriety. \\n\\nThe barbarians, after loosing from Delos, proceeded to touch at the\\nother islands, and took troops from each, and likewise carried off\\na number of the children as hostages. Going thus from one to another,\\nthey came at last to Carystus; but here the hostages were refused\\nby the Carystians, who said they would neither give any, nor consent\\nto bear arms against the cities of their neighbours, meaning Athens\\nand Eretria. Hereupon the Persians laid siege to Carystus, and wasted\\nthe country round, until at length the inhabitants were brought over\\nand agreed to do what was required of them. \\n\\nMeanwhile the Eretrians, understanding that the Persian armament was\\ncoming against them, besought the Athenians for assistance. Nor did\\nthe Athenians refuse their aid, but assigned to them as auxiliaries\\nthe four thousand landholders to whom they had allotted the estates\\nof the Chalcidean Hippobatae. At Eretria, however, things were in\\nno healthy state; for though they had called in the aid of the Athenians,\\nyet they were not agreed among themselves how they should act; some\\nof them were minded to leave the city and to take refuge in the heights\\nof Euboea, while others, who looked to receiving a reward from the\\nPersians, were making ready to betray their country. So when these\\nthings came to the ears of Aeschines, the son of Nothon, one of the\\nfirst men in Eretria, he made known the whole state of affairs to\\nthe Athenians who were already arrived, and besought them to return\\nhome to their own land, and not perish with his countrymen. And the\\nAthenians hearkened to his counsel, and, crossing over to Oropus,\\nin this way escaped the danger. \\n\\nThe Persian fleet now drew near and anchored at Tamynae, Choereae,\\nand Aegilia, three places in the territory of Eretria. Once masters\\nof these posts, they proceeded forthwith to disembark their horses,\\nand made ready to attack the enemy. But the Eretrians were not minded\\nto sally forth and offer battle; their only care, after it had been\\nresolved not to quit the city, was, if possible, to defend their walls.\\nAnd now the fortress was assaulted in good earnest, and for six days\\nthere fell on both sides vast numbers, but on the seventh day Euphorbus,\\nthe son of Alcimachus, and Philagrus, the son of Cyneas, who were\\nboth citizens of good repute, betrayed the place to the Persians.\\nThese were no sooner entered within the walls than they plundered\\nand burnt all the temples that there were in the town, in revenge\\nfor the burning of their own temples at Sardis; moreover, they did\\naccording to the orders of Darius, and carried away captive all the\\ninhabitants. \\n\\nThe Persians, having thus brought Eretria into subjection after waiting\\na few days, made sail for Attica, greatly straitening the Athenians\\nas they approached, and thinking to deal with them as they had dealt\\nwith the people of Eretria. And, because there was no Place in all\\nAttica so convenient for their horse as Marathon, and it lay moreover\\nquite close to Eretria, therefore Hippias, the son of Pisistratus,\\nconducted them thither. \\n\\nWhen intelligence of this reached the Athenians, they likewise marched\\ntheir troops to Marathon, and there stood on the defensive, having\\nat their head ten generals, of whom one was Miltiades. \\n\\nNow this man\\'s father, Cimon, the son of Stesagoras, was banished\\nfrom Athens by Pisistratus, the son of Hippocrates. In his banishment\\nit was his fortune to win the four-horse chariot-race at Olympia,\\nwhereby he gained the very same honour which had before been carried\\noff by Miltiades, his half-brother on the mother\\'s side. At the next\\nOlympiad he won the prize again with the same mares; upon which he\\ncaused Pisistratus to be proclaimed the winner, having made an agreement\\nwith him that on yielding him this honour he should be allowed to\\ncome back to his country. Afterwards, still with the same mares, he\\nwon the prize a third time; whereupon he was put to death by the sons\\nof Pisistratus, whose father was no longer living. They set men to\\nlie in wait for him secretly; and these men slew him near the government-house\\nin the night-time. He was buried outside the city, beyond what is\\ncalled the Valley Road; and right opposite his tomb were buried the\\nmares which had won the three prizes. The same success had likewise\\nbeen achieved once previously, to wit, by the mares of Evagoras the\\nLacedaemonian, but never except by them. At the time of Cimon\\'s death\\nStesagoras, the elder of his two sons, was in the Chersonese, where\\nhe lived with Miltiades his uncle; the younger, who was called Miltiades\\nafter the founder of the Chersonesite colony, was with his father\\nin Athens. \\n\\nIt was this Miltiades who now commanded the Athenians, after escaping\\nfrom the Chersonese, and twice nearly losing his life. First he was\\nchased as far as Imbrus by the Phoenicians, who had a great desire\\nto take him and carry him up to the king; and when he had avoided\\nthis danger, and, having reached his own country, thought himself\\nto be altogether in safety, he found his enemies waiting for him,\\nand was cited by them before a court and impeached for his tyranny\\nin the Chersonese. But he came off victorious here likewise, and was\\nthereupon made general of the Athenians by the free choice of the\\npeople. \\n\\nAnd first, before they left the city, the generals sent off to Sparta\\na herald, one Pheidippides, who was by birth an Athenian, and by profession\\nand practice a trained runner. This man, according to the account\\nwhich he gave to the Athenians on his return, when he was near Mount\\nParthenium, above Tegea, fell in with the god Pan, who called him\\nby his name, and bade him ask the Athenians \"wherefore they neglected\\nhim so entirely, when he was kindly disposed towards them, and had\\noften helped them in times past, and would do so again in time to\\ncome?\" The Athenians, entirely believing in the truth of this report,\\nas soon as their affairs were once more in good order, set up a temple\\nto Pan under the Acropolis, and, in return for the message which I\\nhave recorded, established in his honour yearly sacrifices and a torch-race.\\n\\nOn the occasion of which we speak when Pheidippides was sent by the\\nAthenian generals, and, according to his own account, saw Pan on his\\njourney, he reached Sparta on the very next day after quitting the\\ncity of Athens- Upon his arrival he went before the rulers, and said\\nto them:- \\n\\n\"Men of Lacedaemon, the Athenians beseech you to hasten to their aid,\\nand not allow that state, which is the most ancient in all Greece,\\nto be enslaved by the barbarians. Eretria, look you, is already carried\\naway captive; and Greece weakened by the loss of no mean city.\"\\n\\nThus did Pheidippides deliver the message committed to him. And the\\nSpartans wished to help the Athenians, but were unable to give them\\nany present succour, as they did not like to break their established\\nlaw. It was then the ninth day of the first decade; and they could\\nnot march out of Sparta on the ninth, when the moon had not reached\\nthe full. So they waited for the full of the moon. \\n\\nThe barbarians were conducted to Marathon by Hippias. the son of Pisistratus,\\nwho the night before had seen a strange vision in his sleep. He dreamt\\nof lying in his mother\\'s arms, and conjectured the dream to mean that\\nhe would be restored to Athens, recover the power which he had lost,\\nand afterwards live to a good old age in his native country. Such\\nwas the sense in which he interpreted the vision. He now proceeded\\nto act as guide to the Persians; and, in the first place, he landed\\nthe prisoners taken from Eretria upon the island that is called Aegileia,\\na tract belonging to the Styreans, after which he brought the fleet\\nto anchor off Marathon, and marshalled the bands of the barbarians\\nas they disembarked. As he was thus employed it chanced that he sneezed\\nand at the same time coughed with more violence than was his wont.\\nNow, as he was a man advanced in years, and the greater number of\\nhis teeth were loose, it so happened that one of them was driven out\\nwith the force of the cough, and fell down into the sand. Hippias\\ntook all the pains he could to find it; but the tooth was nowhere\\nto be seen: whereupon he fetched a deep sigh, and said to the bystanders:-\\n\\n\"After all, the land is not ours; and we shall never be able to bring\\nit under. All my share in it is the portion of which my tooth has\\npossession.\" \\n\\nSo Hippias believed that in this way his dream was fulfilled.\\n\\nThe Athenians were drawn up in order of battle in a sacred close belonging\\nto Hercules, when they were joined by the Plataeans, who came in full\\nforce to their aid. Some time before, the Plataeans had put themselves\\nunder the rule of the Athenians; and these last had already undertaken\\nmany labours on their behalf. The occasion of the surrender was the\\nfollowing. The Plataeans suffered grievous things at the hands of\\nthe men of Thebes; so, as it chanced that Cleomenes, the son of Anaxandridas,\\nand the Lacedaemonians were in their neighbourhood, they first of\\nall offered to surrender themselves to them. But the Lacedaemonians\\nrefused to receive them, and said:- \\n\\n\"We dwell too far off from you, and ours would be but chill succour.\\nYe might oftentimes be carried into slavery before one of us heard\\nof it. We counsel you rather to give yourselves up to the Athenians,\\nwho are your next neighbours, and well able to shelter you.\"\\n\\nThis they said, not so much out of good will towards the Plataeans\\nas because they wished to involve the Athenians in trouble by engaging\\nthem in wars with the Boeotians. The Plataeans, however, when the\\nLacedaemonians gave them this counsel, complied at once; and when\\nthe sacrifice to the Twelve Gods was being offered at Athens, they\\ncame and sat as suppliants about the altar, and gave themselves up\\nto the Athenians. The Thebans no sooner learnt what the Plataeans\\nhad done than instantly they marched out against them, while the Athenians\\nsent troops to their aid. As the two armies were about to join battle,\\nthe Corinthians, who chanced to be at hand, would not allow them to\\nengage; both sides consented to take them for arbitrators, whereupon\\nthey made up the quarrel, and fixed the boundary-line between the\\ntwo states upon this condition: to wit, that if any of the Boeotians\\nwished no longer to belong to Boeotia, the Thebans should allow them\\nto follow their own inclinations. The Corinthians, when they had thus\\ndecreed, forthwith departed to their homes: the Athenians likewise\\nset off on their return; but the Boeotians fell upon them during the\\nmarch, and a battle was fought wherein they were worsted by the Athenians.\\nHereupon these last would not be bound by the line which the Corinthians\\nhad fixed, but advanced beyond those limits, and made the Asopus the\\nboundary-line between the country of the Thebans and that of the Plataeans\\nand Hysians. Under such circumstances did the Plataeans give themselves\\nup to Athens; and now they were come to Marathon to bear the Athenians\\naid. \\n\\nThe Athenian generals were divided in their opinions; and some advised\\nnot to risk a battle, because they were too few to engage such a host\\nas that of the Medes, while others were for fighting at once; and\\namong these last was Miltiades. He therefore, seeing that opinions\\nwere thus divided, and that the less worthy counsel appeared likely\\nto prevail, resolved to go to the Polemarch, and have a conference\\nwith him. For the man on whom the lot fell to be Polemarch at Athens\\nwas entitled to give his vote with the ten generals, since anciently\\nthe Athenians allowed him an equal right of voting with them. The\\nPolemarch at this juncture was Callimachus of Aphidnae; to him therefore\\nMiltiades went, and said:- \\n\\n\"With thee it rests, Callimachus, either to bring Athens to slavery,\\nor, by securing her freedom, to leave behind thee to all future generations\\na memory beyond even Harmodius and Aristogeiton. For never since the\\ntime that the Athenians became a people were they in so great a danger\\nas now. If they bow their necks beneath the yoke of the Medes, the\\nwoes which they will have to suffer when given into the power of Hippias\\nare already determined on; if, on the other hand, they fight and overcome,\\nAthens may rise to be the very first city in Greece. How it comes\\nto pass that these things are likely to happen, and how the determining\\nof them in some sort rests with thee, I will now proceed to make clear.\\nWe generals are ten in number, and our votes are divided; half of\\nus wish to engage, half to avoid a combat. Now, if we do not fight,\\nI look to see a great disturbance at Athens which will shake men\\'s\\nresolutions, and then I fear they will submit themselves; but if we\\nfight the battle before any unsoundness show itself among our citizens,\\nlet the gods but give us fair play, and we are well able to overcome\\nthe enemy. On thee therefore we depend in this matter, which lies\\nwholly in thine own power. Thou hast only to add thy vote to my side\\nand thy country will be free, and not free only, but the first state\\nin Greece. Or, if thou preferrest to give thy vote to them who would\\ndecline the combat, then the reverse will follow.\" \\n\\nMiltiades by these words gained Callimachus; and the addition of the\\nPolemarch\\'s vote caused the decision to be in favour of fighting.\\nHereupon all those generals who had been desirous of hazarding a battle,\\nwhen their turn came to command the army, gave up their right to Miltiades.\\nHe however, though he accepted their offers, nevertheless waited,\\nand would not fight until his own day of command arrived in due course.\\n\\nThen at length, when his own turn was come, the Athenian battle was\\nset in array, and this was the order of it. Callimachus the Polemarch\\nled the right wing; for it was at that time a rule with the Athenians\\nto give the right wing to the Polemarch. After this followed the tribes,\\naccording as they were numbered, in an unbroken line; while last of\\nall came the Plataeans, forming the left wing. And ever since that\\nday it has been a custom with the Athenians, in the sacrifices and\\nassemblies held each fifth year at Athens, for the Athenian herald\\nto implore the blessing of the gods on the Plataeans conjointly with\\nthe Athenians. Now, as they marshalled the host upon the field of\\nMarathon, in order that the Athenian front might he of equal length\\nwith the Median, the ranks of the centre were diminished, and it became\\nthe weakest part of the line, while the wings were both made strong\\nwith a depth of many ranks. \\n\\nSo when the battle was set in array, and the victims showed themselves\\nfavourable, instantly the Athenians, so soon as they were let go,\\ncharged the barbarians at a run. Now the distance between the two\\narmies was little short of eight furlongs. The Persians, therefore,\\nwhen they saw the Greeks coming on at speed, made ready to receive\\nthem, although it seemed to them that the Athenians were bereft of\\ntheir senses, and bent upon their own destruction; for they saw a\\nmere handful of men coming on at a run without either horsemen or\\narchers. Such was the opinion of the barbarians; but the Athenians\\nin close array fell upon them, and fought in a manner worthy of being\\nrecorded. They were the first of the Greeks, so far as I know, who\\nintroduced the custom of charging the enemy at a run, and they were\\nlikewise the first who dared to look upon the Median garb, and to\\nface men clad in that fashion. Until this time the very name of the\\nMedes had been a terror to the Greeks to hear. \\n\\nThe two armies fought together on the plain of Marathon for a length\\nof time; and in the mid battle, where the Persians themselves and\\nthe Sacae had their place, the barbarians were victorious, and broke\\nand pursued the Greeks into the inner country; but on the two wings\\nthe Athenians and the Plataeans defeated the enemy. Having so done,\\nthey suffered the routed barbarians to fly at their ease, and joining\\nthe two wings in one, fell upon those who had broken their own centre,\\nand fought and conquered them. These likewise fled, and now the Athenians\\nhung upon the runaways and cut them down, chasing them all the way\\nto the shore, on reaching which they laid hold of the ships and called\\naloud for fire. \\n\\nIt was in the struggle here that Callimachus the Polemarch, after\\ngreatly distinguishing himself, lost his life; Stesilaus too, the\\nson of Thrasilaus, one of the generals, was slain; and Cynaegirus,\\nthe son of Euphorion, having seized on a vessel of the enemy\\'s by\\nthe ornament at the stern, had his hand cut off by the blow of an\\naxe, and so perished; as likewise did many other Athenians of note\\nand name. \\n\\nNevertheless the Athenians secured in this way seven of the vessels;\\nwhile with the remainder the barbarians pushed off, and taking aboard\\ntheir Eretrian prisoners from the island where they had left them,\\ndoubled Cape Sunium, hoping to reach Athens before the return of the\\nAthenians. The Alcmaeonidae were accused by their countrymen of suggesting\\nthis course to them; they had, it was said, an understanding with\\nthe Persians, and made a signal to them, by raising a shield, after\\nthey were embarked in their ships. \\n\\nThe Persians accordingly sailed round Sunium. But the Athenians with\\nall possible speed marched away to the defence of their city, and\\nsucceeded in reaching Athens before the appearance of the barbarians:\\nand as their camp at Marathon had been pitched in a precinct of Hercules,\\nso now they encamped in another precinct of the same god at Cynosarges.\\nThe barbarian fleet arrived, and lay to off Phalerum, which was at\\nthat time the haven of Athens; but after resting awhile upon their\\noars, they departed and sailed away to Asia. \\n\\nThere fell in this battle of Marathon, on the side of the barbarians,\\nabout six thousand and four hundred men; on that of the Athenians,\\none hundred and ninety-two. Such was the number of the slain on the\\none side and the other. A strange prodigy likewise happened at this\\nfight. Epizelus, the son of Cuphagoras, an Athenian, was in the thick\\nof the fray, and behaving himself as a brave man should, when suddenly\\nhe was stricken with blindness, without blow of sword or dart; and\\nthis blindness continued thenceforth during the whole of his after\\nlife. The following is the account which he himself, as I have heard,\\ngave of the matter: he said that a gigantic warrior, with a huge beard,\\nwhich shaded all his shield, stood over against him; but the ghostly\\nsemblance passed him by, and slew the man at his side. Such, as I\\nunderstand, was the tale which Epizelus told. \\n\\nDatis meanwhile was on his way back to Asia, and had reached Myconus,\\nwhen he saw in his sleep a vision. What it was is not known; but no\\nsooner was day come than he caused strict search to be made throughout\\nthe whole fleet, and finding on board a Phoenician vessel an image\\nof Apollo overlaid with gold, he inquired from whence it had been\\ntaken, and learning to what temple it belonged, he took it with him\\nin his own ship to Delos, and placed it in the temple there, enjoining\\nthe Delians, who had now come back to their island, to restore the\\nimage to the Theban Delium, which lies on the coast over against Chalcis.\\nHaving left these injunctions, he sailed away; but the Delians failed\\nto restore the statue; and it was not till twenty years afterwards\\nthat the Thebans, warned by an oracle, themselves brought it back\\nto Delium. \\n\\nAs for the Eretrians, whom Datis and Artaphernes had carried away\\ncaptive, when the fleet reached Asia, they were taken up to Susa.\\nNow King Darius, before they were made his prisoners, nourished a\\nfierce anger against these men for having injured him without provocation;\\nbut now that he saw them brought into his presence, and become his\\nsubjects, he did them no other harm, but only settled them at one\\nof his own stations in Cissia- a place called Ardericea- two hundred\\nand ten furlongs distant from Susa, and forty from the well which\\nyields produce of three different kinds. For from this well they get\\nbitumen, salt, and oil, procuring it in the way that I will now describe:\\nthey draw with a swipe, and instead of a bucket make use of the half\\nof a wine-skin; with this the man dips, and after drawing, pours the\\nliquid into a reservoir, wherefrom it passes into another, and there\\ntakes three different shapes. The salt and the bitumen forthwith collect\\nand harden, while the oil is drawn off into casks. It is called by\\nthe Persians \"rhadinace,\" is black, and has an unpleasant smell. Here\\nthen King Darius established the Eretrians; and here they continued\\nto my time, and still spoke their old language. So thus it fared with\\nthe Eretrians. \\n\\nAfter the full of the moon two thousand Lacedaemonians came to Athens.\\nSo eager had they been to arrive in time, that they took but three\\ndays to reach Attica from Sparta. They came, however, too late for\\nthe battle; yet, as they had a longing to behold the Medes, they continued\\ntheir march to Marathon and there viewed the slain. Then, after giving\\nthe Athenians all praise for their achievement, they departed and\\nreturned home.  But it fills me with wonderment, and I can in no wise\\nbelieve the report, that the Alcmaeonidae had an understanding with\\nthe Persians, and held them up a shield as a signal, wishing Athens\\nto be brought under the yoke of the barbarians and of Hippias- the\\nAlcmaeonidae, who have shown themselves at least as bitter haters\\nof tyrants as was Callias, the son of Phaenippus, and father of Hipponicus.\\nThis Callias was the only person at Athens who, when the Pisistratidae\\nwere driven out, and their goods were exposed for sale by the vote\\nof the people, had the courage to make purchases, and likewise in\\nmany other ways to display the strongest hostility. \\n\\nHe was a man very worthy to be had in remembrance by all, on several\\naccounts. For not only did he thus distinguish himself beyond others\\nin the cause of his country\\'s freedom; but likewise, by the honours\\nwhich he gained at the Olympic Games, where he carried off the prize\\nin the horse-race, and was second in the four-horse chariot-race,\\nand by his victory at an earlier period in the Pythian Games, he showed\\nhimself in the eyes of all the Greeks a man most unsparing in his\\nexpenditure. He was remarkable too for his conduct in respect of his\\ndaughters, three in number; for when they came to be of marriageable\\nage, he gave to each of them a most ample dowry, and placed it at\\ntheir own disposal, allowing them to choose their husbands from among\\nall the citizens of Athens, and giving each in marriage to the man\\nof her own choice. \\n\\nNow the Alcmaeonidae fell not a whit short of this person in their\\nhatred of tyrants, so that I am astonished at the charge made against\\nthem, and cannot bring myself to believe that they held up a shield;\\nfor they were men who had remained in exile during the whole time\\nthat the tyranny lasted, and they even contrived the trick by which\\nthe Pisistratidae were deprived of their throne. Indeed I look upon\\nthem as the persons who in good truth gave Athens her freedom far\\nmore than Harmodius and Aristogeiton. For these last did but exasperate\\nthe other Pisistratidae by slaying Hipparchus, and were far from doing\\nanything towards putting down the tyranny: whereas the Alcmaeonidae\\nwere manifestly the actual deliverers of Athens, if at least it be\\ntrue that the Pythoness was prevailed upon by them to bid the Lacedaemonians\\nset Athens free, as I have already related. \\n\\nBut perhaps they were offended with the people of Athens; and therefore\\nbetrayed their country. Nay, but on the contrary there were none of\\nthe Athenians who were held in such general esteem, or who were so\\nladen with honours. So that it is not even reasonable to suppose that\\na shield was held up by them on this account. A shield was shown,\\nno doubt; that cannot be gainsaid; but who it was that showed it I\\ncannot any further determine. \\n\\nNow the Alcmaeonidae were, even in days of yore, a family of note\\nat Athens; but from the time of Alcmaeon, and again of Megacles, they\\nrose to special eminence. The former of these two personages, to wit,\\nAlcmaeon, the son of Megacles, when Croesus the Lydian sent men from\\nSardis to consult the Delphic oracle, gave aid gladly to his messengers,\\nassisted them to accomplish their task. Croesus, informed of Alcmaeon\\'s\\nkindnesses by the Lydians who from time to time conveyed his messages\\nto the god, sent for him to Sardis, and when he arrived, made him\\na present of as much gold as he should be able to carry at one time\\nabout his person. Finding that this was the gift assigned him, Alcmaeon\\ntook his measures, and prepared himself to receive it in the following\\nway. He clothed himself in a loose tunic, which he made to bag greatly\\nat the waist, and placing upon his feet the widest buskins that he\\ncould anywhere find, followed his guides into the treasure-house.\\nHere he fell to upon a heap of gold-dust, and in the first place packed\\nas much as he could inside his buskins, between them and his legs;\\nafter which he filled the breast of his tunic quite full of gold,\\nand then sprinkling some among his hair, and taking some likewise\\nin his mouth, he came forth from the treasure-house, scarcely able\\nto drag his legs along, like anything rather than a man, with his\\nmouth crammed full, and his bulk increased every way. On seeing him,\\nCroesus burst into a laugh, and not only let him have all that he\\nhad taken, but gave him presents besides of fully equal worth. Thus\\nthis house became one of great wealth; and Alcmaeon was able to keep\\nhorses for the chariot-race, and won the prize at Olympia.\\n\\nAfterwards, in the generation which followed, Clisthenes, king of\\nSicyon, raised the family to still greater eminence among the Greeks\\nthan even that to which it had attained before. For this Clisthenes,\\nwho was the son of Aristonymus, the grandson of Myron, and the great-grandson\\nof Andreas, had a daughter, called Agarista, whom he wished to marry\\nto the best husband that he could find in the whole of Greece. At\\nthe Olympic Games, therefore, having gained the prize in the chariot\\nrace, he caused public proclamation to be made to the following effect:-\\n\"Whoever among the Greeks deems himself worthy to become the son-in-law\\nof Clisthenes, let him come, sixty days hence, or, if he will, sooner,\\nto Sicyon; for within a year\\'s time, counting from the end of the\\nsixty days, Clisthenes will decide on the man to whom he shall contract\\nhis daughter.\" So all the Greeks who were proud of their own merit\\nor of their country flocked to Sicyon as suitors; and Clisthenes had\\na foot-course and a wrestling-ground made ready, to try their powers.\\n\\nFrom Italy there came Smindyrides, the son of Hippocrates, a native\\nof Sybaris- which city about that time was at the very height of its\\nprosperity. He was a man who in luxuriousness of living exceeded all\\nother persons. Likewise there came Damasus, the son of Amyris, surnamed\\nthe Wise, a native of Siris. These two were the only suitors from\\nItaly. From the Ionian Gulf appeared Amphimnestus, the son of Epistrophus,\\nan Epidamnian; from Aetolia, Males, the brother of that Titormus who\\nexcelled all the Greeks in strength, and who wishing to avoid his\\nfellow-men, withdrew himself into the remotest parts of the Aetolian\\nterritory. From the Peloponnese came several- Leocedes, son of that\\nPheidon, king of the Argives, who established weights and measures\\nthroughout the Peloponnese, and was the most insolent of all the Grecians-\\nthe same who drove out the Elean directors of the Games, and himself\\npresided over the contests at Olympia- Leocedes, I say, appeared,\\nthis Pheidon\\'s son; and likewise Amiantus, son of Lycurgus, an Arcadian\\nof the city of Trapezus; Laphanes, an Azenian of Paeus, whose father,\\nEuphorion, as the story goes in Arcadia, entertained the Dioscuri\\nat his residence, and thenceforth kept open house for all comers;\\nand lastly, Onomastus, the son of Agaeus, a native of Elis. These\\nfour came from the Peloponnese. From Athens there arrived Megacles,\\nthe son of that Alcmaeon who visited Croesus, and Tisander\\'s son,\\nHippoclides, the wealthiest and handsomest of the Athenians. There\\nwas likewise one Euboean, Lysanias, who came from Eretria, then a\\nflourishing city. From Thessaly came Diactorides, a Cranonian, of\\nthe race of the Scopadae; and Alcon arrived from the Molossians. This\\nwas the list of the suitors. \\n\\nNow when they were all come, and the day appointed had arrived, Clisthenes\\nfirst of all inquired of each concerning his country and his family;\\nafter which he kept them with him a year, and made trial of their\\nmanly bearing, their temper, their accomplishments, and their disposition,\\nsometimes drawing them apart for converse, sometimes bringing them\\nall together. Such as were still youths he took with him from time\\nto time to the gymnasia; but the greatest trial of all was at the\\nbanquettable. During the whole period of their stay he lived with\\nthem as I have said; and, further, from first to last he entertained\\nthem sumptuously. Somehow or other the suitors who came from Athens\\npleased him the best of all; and of these Hippoclides, Tisander\\'s\\nson, was specially in favour, partly on account of his manly bearing,\\nand partly also because his ancestors were of kin to the Corinthian\\nCypselids. \\n\\nWhen at length the day arrived which had been fixed for the espousals,\\nand Clisthenes had to speak out and declare his choice, he first of\\nall made a sacrifice of a hundred oxen, and held a banquet, whereat\\nhe entertained all the suitors and the whole people of Sicyon. After\\nthe feast was ended, the suitors vied with each other in music and\\nin speaking on a given subject. Presently, as the drinking advanced,\\nHippoclides, who quite dumbfoundered the rest, called aloud to the\\nflute-player, and bade him strike up a dance; which the man did, and\\nHippoclides danced to it. And he fancied that he was dancing excellently\\nwell; but Clisthenes, who was observing him, began to misdoubt the\\nwhole business. Then Hippoclides, after a pause, told an attendant\\nto bring in a table; and when it was brought, he mounted upon it and\\ndanced first of all some Laconian figures, then some Attic ones; after\\nwhich he stood on his head upon the table, and began to toss his legs\\nabout. Clisthenes, notwithstanding that he now loathed Hippoclides\\nfor a son-in-law, by reason of his dancing and his shamelessness,\\nstill, as he wished to avoid an outbreak, had restrained himself during\\nthe first and likewise during the second dance; when, however, he\\nsaw him tossing his legs in the air, he could no longer contain himself,\\nbut cried out, \"Son of Tisander, thou hast danced thy wife away!\"\\n\"What does Hippoclides care?\" was the other\\'s answer. And hence the\\nproverb arose. \\n\\nThen Clisthenes commanded silence, and spake thus before the assembled\\ncompany:- \\n\\n\"Suitors of my daughter, well pleased am I with you all; and right\\nwillingly, if it were possible, would I content you all, and not by\\nmaking choice of one appear to put a slight upon the rest. But as\\nit is out of my power, seeing that I have but one daughter, to grant\\nto all their wishes, I will present to each of you whom I must needs\\ndismiss a talent of silver, for the honour that you have done me in\\nseeking to ally yourselves with my house, and for your long absence\\nfrom your homes. But my daughter, Agarista, I betroth to Megacles,\\nthe son of Alcmaeon, to be his wife, according to the usage and wont\\nof Athens.\" \\n\\nThen Megacles expressed his readiness; and Clisthenes had the marriage\\nsolemnised. \\n\\nThus ended the affair of the suitors; and thus the Alcmaeonidae came\\nto be famous throughout the whole of Greece. The issue of this marriage\\nwas the Clisthenes named after his grandfather the Sicyonian- who\\nmade the tribes at Athens, and set up the popular government. Megacles\\nhad likewise another son, called Hippocrates, whose children were\\na Megacles and an Agarista, the latter named after Agarista the daughter\\nof Clisthenes. She married Xanthippus, the son of Ariphron; and when\\nshe was with child by him had a dream, wherein she fancied that she\\nwas delivered of a lion; after which, within a few days, she bore\\nXanthippus a son, to wit, Pericles. \\n\\nAfter the blow struck at Marathon, Miltiades, who was previously held\\nin high esteem by his countrymen, increased yet more in influence.\\nHence, when he told them that he wanted a fleet of seventy ships,\\nwith an armed force, and money, without informing them what country\\nhe was going to attack, but only promising to enrich them if they\\nwould accompany him, seeing that it was a right wealthy land, where\\nthey might easily get as much gold as they cared to have- when he\\ntold them this, they were quite carried away, and gave him the whole\\narmament which he required. \\n\\nSo Miltiades, having got the armament, sailed against Paros, with\\nthe object, as he alleged, of punishing the Parians for having gone\\nto war with Athens, inasmuch as a trireme of theirs had come with\\nthe Persian fleet to Marathon. This, however, was a mere pretence;\\nthe truth was, that Miltiades owed the Parians a grudge, because Lysagoras,\\nthe son of Tisias, who was a Parian by birth, had told tales against\\nhim to Hydarnes the Persian. Arrived before the place against which\\nhis expedition was designed, he drove the Parians within their walls,\\nand forthwith laid siege to the city. At the same time he sent a herald\\nto the inhabitants, and required of them a hundred talents, threatening\\nthat, if they refused, he would press the siege, and never give it\\nover till the town was taken. But the Parians, without giving his\\ndemand a thought, proceeded to use every means that they could devise\\nfor the defence of their city, and even invented new plans for the\\npurpose, one of which was, by working at night, to raise such parts\\nof the wall as were likely to be carried by assault to double their\\nformer height. \\n\\nThus far all the Greeks agree in their accounts of this business;\\nwhat follows is related upon the testimony of the Parians only. Miltiades\\nhad come to his wit\\'s end, when one of the prisoners, a woman named\\nTimo, who was by birth a Parian, and had held the office of under-priestess\\nin the temple of the infernal goddesses, came and conferred with him.\\nThis woman, they say, being introduced into the presence of Miltiades,\\nadvised him, if he set great store by the capture of the place, to\\ndo something which she could suggest to him. When therefore she had\\ntold him what it was she meant, he betook himself to the hill which\\nlies in front of the city, and there leapt the fence enclosing the\\nprecinct of Ceres Thesmophorus, since he was not able to open the\\ndoor. After leaping into the place he went straight to the sanctuary,\\nintending to do something within it- either to remove some of the\\nholy things which it was not lawful to stir, or to perform some act\\nor other, I cannot say what- and had just reached the door, when suddenly\\na feeling of horror came upon him, and he returned back the way he\\nhad come; but in jumping down from the outer wall, he strained his\\nthigh, or, as some say, struck the ground with his knee.\\n\\nSo Miltiades returned home sick, without bringing the Athenians any\\nmoney, and without conquering Paros, having done no more than to besiege\\nthe town for six-and-twenty days, and ravage the remainder of the\\nisland. The Parians, however, when it came to their knowledge that\\nTimo, the under-priestess of the goddesses, had advised Miltiades\\nwhat he should do, were minded to punish her for her crime; they therefore\\nsent messengers to Delphi, as soon as the siege was at an end, and\\nasked the god if they should put the under-priestess to death. \"She\\nhad discovered,\" they said, \"to the enemies of her country how they\\nmight bring it into subjection, and had exhibited to Miltiades mysteries\\nwhich it was not lawful for a man to know.\" But the Pythoness forbade\\nthem, and said, \"Timo was not in fault; \\'twas decreed that Miltiades\\nshould come to an unhappy end; and she was sent to lure him to his\\ndestruction.\" Such was the answer given to the Parians by the Pythoness.\\n\\nThe Athenians, upon the return of Miltiades from Paros, had much debate\\nconcerning him; and Xanthippus, the son of Ariphron, who spoke more\\nfreely against him than all the rest, impleaded him before the people,\\nand brought him to trial for his life, on the charge of having dealt\\ndeceitfully with the Athenians. Miltiades, though he was present in\\ncourt, did not speak in his own defence; for his thigh had begun to\\nmortify, and disabled him from pleading his cause. He was forced to\\nlie on a couch while his defence was made by his friends, who dwelt\\nat most length on the fight at Marathon, while they made mention also\\nof the capture of Lemnos, telling how Miltiades took the island, and,\\nafter executing vengeance on the Pelasgians, gave up his conquest\\nto Athens. The judgment of the people was in his favour so far as\\nto spare his life; but for the wrong he had done them they fined him\\nfifty talents. Soon afterwards his thigh completely gangrened and\\nmortified: and so Miltiades died; and the fifty talents were paid\\nby his son Cimon. \\n\\nNow the way in which Miltiades had made himself master of Lemnos was\\nthe following. There were certain Pelasgians whom the Athenians once\\ndrove out of Attica; whether they did it- justly or unjustly I cannot\\nsay, since I only know what is reported concerning it, which is the\\nfollowing: Hecataeus, the son of Hegesander, says in his History that\\nit was unjustly. \"The Athenians,\" according to him, \"had given to\\nthe Pelasgi a tract of land at the foot of Hymettus as payment for\\nthe wall with which the Pelasgians had surrounded their citadel. This\\nland was barren, and little worth at the time; but the Pelasgians\\nbrought it into good condition; whereupon the Athenians begrudged\\nthem the tract, and desired to recover it. And so, without any better\\nexcuse, they took arms and drove out the Pelasgians.\" But the Athenians\\nmaintain that they were justified in what they did. \"The Pelasgians,\"\\nthey say, \"while they lived at the foot of Hymettus, were wont to\\nsally forth from that region and commit outrages on their children.\\nFor the Athenians used at that time to send their sons and daughters\\nto draw water at the fountain called \\'the Nine Springs,\\' inasmuch\\nas neither they nor the other Greeks had any household slaves in those\\ndays; and the maidens, whenever they came, were used rudely and insolently\\nby the Pelasgians. Nor were they even content thus; but at the last\\nthey laid a plot, and were caught by the Athenians in the act of making\\nan attempt upon their city. Then did the Athenians give a proof how\\nmuch better men they were than the Pelasgians; for whereas they might\\njustly have killed them all, having caught them in the very act of\\nrebelling, the; spared their lives, and only required that they should\\nleave the country. Hereupon the Pelasgians quitted Attica, and settled\\nin Lemnos and other places.\" Such are the accounts respectively of\\nHecataeus and the Athenians. \\n\\nThese same Pelasgians, after they were settled in Lemnos, conceived\\nthe wish to be revenged on the Athenians. So, as they were well acquainted\\nwith the Athenian festivals, they manned some penteconters, and having\\nlaid an ambush to catch the Athenian women as they kept the festival\\nof Diana at Brauron, they succeeded in carrying off a large number,\\nwhom they took to Lemnos and there kept as concubines. After a while\\nthe women bore children, whom they taught to speak the language of\\nAttica and observe the manners of the Athenians. These boys refused\\nto have any commerce with the sons of the Pelasgian women; and if\\na Pelasgian boy struck one of their number, they all made common cause,\\nand joined in avenging their comrade; nay, the Greek boys even set\\nup a claim to exercise lordship over the others, and succeeded in\\ngaining the upper hand. When these things came to the ears of the\\nPelasgians, they took counsel together, and, on considering the matter,\\nthey grew frightened, and said one to another, \"If these boys even\\nnow are resolved to make common cause against the sons of our lawful\\nwives, and seek to exercise lordship over them, what may we expect\\nwhen they grow up to be men?\" Then it seemed good to the Pelasgians\\nto kill all the sons of the Attic women; which they did accordingly,\\nand at the same time slew likewise their mothers. From this deed,\\nand that former crime of the Lemnian women, when they slew their husbands\\nin the days of Thoas, it has come to be usual throughout Greece to\\ncall wicked actions by the name of \"Lemnian deeds.\" \\n\\nWhen the Pelasgians had thus slain their children and their women,\\nthe earth refused to bring forth its fruits for them, and their wives\\nbore fewer children, and their flocks and herds increased more slowly\\nthan before, till at last, sore pressed by famine and bereavement,\\nthey sent men to Delphi, and begged the god to tell them how they\\nmight obtain deliverance from their sufferings. The Pythoness answered\\nthat \"they must give the Athenians whatever satisfaction they might\\ndemand.\" Then the Pelasgians went to Athens and declared their wish\\nto give the Athenians satisfaction for the wrong which they had done\\nto them. So the Athenians had a couch prepared in their townhall,\\nand adorned it with the fairest coverlets, and set by its side a table\\nladen with all manner of good things, and then told the Pelasgians\\nthey must deliver up their country to them in a similar condition.\\nThe Pelasgians answered and said, \"When a ship comes with a north\\nwind from your country to ours in a single day, then will we give\\nit up to you.\" This they said because they knew that what they required\\nwas impossible, for Attica lies a long way to the south of Lemnos.\\n\\nNo more passed at that time. But very many years afterwards, when\\nthe Hellespontian Chersonese had been brought under the power of Athens,\\nMiltiades, the son of Cimon, sailed, during the prevalence of the\\nEtesian winds, from Elaeus in the Chersonese to Lemnos, and called\\non the Pelasgians to quit their island, reminding them of the prophecy\\nwhich they had supposed it impossible to fulfil. The people of Hephaestia\\nobeyed the call; but they of Myrina, not acknowledging the Chersonese\\nto be any part of Attica, refused and were besieged and brought over\\nby force. Thus was Lemnos gained by the Athenians and Miltiades.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nBOOK VII\\n\\nPolymnia \\n\\nNow when tidings of the battle that had been fought at Marathon reached\\nthe ears of King Darius, the son of Hystaspes, his anger against the\\nAthenians, which had been already roused by their attack upon Sardis,\\nwaxed still fiercer, and he became more than ever eager to lead an\\narmy against Greece. Instantly he sent off messengers to make proclamation\\nthrough the several states that fresh levies were to be raised, and\\nthese at an increased rate; while ships, horses, provisions, and transports\\nwere likewise to be furnished. So the men published his commands;\\nand now all Asia was in commotion by the space of three years, while\\neverywhere, as Greece was to be attacked, the best and bravest were\\nenrolled for the service, and had to make their preparations accordingly.\\n\\nAfter this, in the fourth year, the Egyptians whom Cambyses had enslaved\\nrevolted from the Persians; whereupon Darius was more hot for war\\nthan ever, and earnestly desired to march an army against both adversaries.\\n\\nNow, as he was about to lead forth his levies against Egypt and Athens,\\na fierce contention for the sovereign power arose among his sons;\\nsince the law of the Persians was that a king must not go out with\\nhis army, until he has appointed one to succeed him upon the throne.\\nDarius, before he obtained the kingdom, had had three sons born to\\nhim from his former wife, who was a daughter of Gobryas; while, since\\nhe began to reign, Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus, had borne him four.\\nArtabazanes was the eldest of the first family, and Xerxes of the\\nsecond. These two, therefore, being the sons of different mothers,\\nwere now at variance. Artabazanes claimed the crown as the eldest\\nof all the children, because it was an established custom all over\\nthe world for the eldest to have the pre-eminence; while Xerxes, on\\nthe other hand, urged that he was sprung from Atossa, the daughter\\nof Cyrus, and that it was Cyrus who had won the Persians their freedom.\\n\\nBefore Darius had pronounced on the matter, it happened that Demaratus,\\nthe son of Ariston, who had been deprived of his crown at Sparta,\\nand had afterwards, of his own accord, gone into banishment, came\\nup to Susa, and there heard of the quarrel of the princes. Hereupon,\\nas report says, he went to Xerxes, and advised him, in addition to\\nall that he had urged before, to plead- that at the time when he was\\nborn Darius was already king, and bore rule over the Persians; but\\nwhen Artabazanes came into the world, he was a mere private person.\\nIt would therefore be neither right nor seemly that the crown should\\ngo to another in preference to himself. \"For at Sparta,\" said Demaratus,\\nbyway of suggestion, \"the law is that if a king has sons before he\\ncomes to the throne, and another son is born to him afterwards, the\\nchild so born is heir to his father\\'s kingdom.\" Xerxes followed this\\ncounsel, and Darius, persuaded that he had justice on his side, appointed\\nhim his successor. For my own part I believe that, even without this,\\nthe crown would have gone to Xerxes; for Atossa was all-powerful.\\n\\nDarius, when he had thus appointed Xerxes his heir, was minded to\\nlead forth his armies; but he was prevented by death while his preparations\\nwere still proceeding. He died in the year following the revolt of\\nEgypt and the matters here related, after having reigned in all six-and-thirty\\nyears, leaving the revolted Egyptians and the Athenians alike unpunished.\\nAt his death the kingdom passed to his son Xerxes. \\n\\nNow Xerxes, on first mounting the throne, was coldly disposed towards\\nthe Grecian war, and made it his business to collect an army against\\nEgypt. But Mardonius, the son of Gobryas, who was at the court, and\\nhad more influence with him than any of the other Persians, being\\nhis own cousin, the child of a sister of Darius, plied him with discourses\\nlike the following:- \\n\\n\"Master, it is not fitting that they of Athens escape scot-free, after\\ndoing the Persians such great injury. Complete the work which thou\\nhast now in hand, and then, when the pride of Egypt is brought low,\\nlead an army against Athens. So shalt thou thyself have good report\\namong men, and others shall fear hereafter to attack thy country.\"\\n\\nThus far it was of vengeance that he spoke; but sometimes he would\\nvary the theme, and observe by the way, \"that Europe was a wondrous\\nbeautiful region, rich in all kinds of cultivated trees, and the soil\\nexcellent: no one, save the king, was worthy to own such a land.\"\\n\\nAll this he said, because he longed for adventures, and hoped to become\\nsatrap of Greece under the king; and after a while he had his way,\\nand persuaded Xerxes to do according to his desires. Other things,\\nhowever, occurring about the same time, helped his persuasions. For,\\nin the first place, it chanced that messengers arrived from Thessaly,\\nsent by the Aleuadae, Thessalian kings, to invite Xerxes into Greece,\\nand to promise him all the assistance which it was in their power\\nto give. And further, the Pisistratidae, who had come up to Susa,\\nheld the same language as the Aleuadae, and worked upon him even more\\nthan they, by means of Onomacritus of Athens, an oracle-monger, and\\nthe same who set forth the prophecies of Musaeus in their order. The\\nPisistratidae had previously been at enmity with this man, but made\\nup the quarrel before they removed to Susa. He was banished from Athens\\nby Hipparchus, the son of Pisistratus, because he foisted into the\\nwritings of Musaeus a prophecy that the islands which lie off Lemnos\\nwould one day disappear in the sea. Lasus of Hermione caught him in\\nthe act of so doing. For this cause Hipparchus banished him, though\\ntill then they had been the closest of friends. Now, however, he went\\nup to Susa with the sons of Pisistratus, and they talked very grandly\\nof him to the king; while he, for his part, whenever he was in the\\nking\\'s company, repeated to him certain of the oracles; and while\\nhe took care to pass over all that spoke of disaster to the barbarians,\\nbrought forward the passages which promised them the greatest success.\\n\"\\'Twas fated,\" he told Xerxes, \"that a Persian should bridge the Hellespont,\\nand march an army from Asia into Greece.\" While Onomacritus thus plied\\nXerxes with his oracles, the Pisistratidae and Aleuadae did not cease\\nto press on him their advice, till at last the king yielded, and agreed\\nto lead forth an expedition. \\n\\nFirst, however, in the year following the death of Darius, he marched\\nagainst those who had revolted from him; and having reduced them,\\nand laid all Egypt under a far harder yoke than ever his father had\\nput upon it, he gave the government to Achaeamenes, who was his own\\nbrother, and son to Darius. This Achaeamenes was afterwards slain\\nin his government by Inaros, the son of Psammetichus, a Libyan.\\n\\n(SS 1.) After Egypt was subdued, Xerxes, being about to take in hand\\nthe expedition against Athens, called together an assembly of the\\nnoblest Persians to learn their opinions, and to lay before them his\\nown designs. So, when the men were met, the king spake thus to them:-\\n\\n\"Persians, I shall not be the first to bring in among you a new custom-\\nI shall but follow one which has come down to us from our forefathers.\\nNever yet, as our old men assure me, has our race reposed itself,\\nsince the time when Cyrus overcame Astyages, and so we Persians wrested\\nthe sceptre from the Medes. Now in all this God guides us; and we,\\nobeying his guidance, prosper greatly. What need have I to tell you\\nof the deeds of Cyrus and Cambyses, and my own father Darius, how\\nmany nations they conquered, and added to our dominions? Ye know right\\nwell what great things they achieved. But for myself, I will say that,\\nfrom the day on which I mounted the throne, I have not ceased to consider\\nby what means I may rival those who have preceded me in this post\\nof honour, and increase the power of Persia as much as any of them.\\nAnd truly I have pondered upon this, until at last I have found out\\na way whereby we may at once win glory, and likewise get possession\\nof a land which is as large and as rich as our own nay, which is even\\nmore varied in the fruits it bears- while at the same time we obtain\\nsatisfaction and revenge. For this cause I have now called you together,\\nthat I may make known to you what I design to do. (SS 2.) My intent\\nis to throw a bridge over the Hellespont and march an army through\\nEurope against Greece, that thereby I may obtain vengeance from the\\nAthenians for the wrongs committed by them against the Persians and\\nagainst my father. Your own eyes saw the preparations of Darius against\\nthese men; but death came upon him, and balked his hopes of revenge.\\nIn his behalf, therefore, and in behalf of all the Persians, I undertake\\nthe war, and pledge myself not to rest till I have taken and burnt\\nAthens, which has dared, unprovoked, to injure me and my father. Long\\nsince they came to Asia with Aristagoras of Miletus, who was one of\\nour slaves, and, entering Sardis, burnt its temples and its sacred\\ngroves; again, more lately, when we made a landing upon their coast\\nunder Datis and Artaphernes, how roughly they handled us ye do not\\nneed to be told. (SS 3.) For these reasons, therefore, I am bent upon\\nthis war; and I see likewise therewith united no few advantages. Once\\nlet us subdue this people, and those neighbours of theirs who hold\\nthe land of Pelops the Phrygian, and we shall extend the Persian territory\\nas far as God\\'s heaven reaches. The sun will then shine on no land\\nbeyond our borders; for I will pass through Europe from one end to\\nthe other, and with your aid make of all the lands which it contains\\none country. For thus, if what I hear be true, affairs stand: the\\nnations whereof I have spoken, once swept away, there is no city,\\nno country left in all the world, which will venture so much as to\\nwithstand us in arms. By this course then we shall bring all mankind\\nunder our yoke, alike those who are guilty and those who are innocent\\nof doing us wrong. (SS 4.) For yourselves, if you wish to please me,\\ndo as follows: when I announce the time for the army to meet together,\\nhasten to the muster with a good will, every one of you; and know\\nthat to the man who brings with him the most gallant array I will\\ngive the gifts which our people consider the most honourable. This\\nthen is what ye have to do. But to show that I am not self-willed\\nin this matter, I lay the business before you, and give you full leave\\nto speak your minds upon it openly.\" \\n\\nXerxes, having so spoken, held his peace. \\n(SS 1.) Whereupon Mardonius took the word, and said: \"Of a truth,\\nmy lord, thou dost surpass, not only all living Persians, but likewise\\nthose yet unborn. Most true and right is each word that thou hast\\nnow uttered; but best of all thy resolve not to let the Ionians who\\nlive in Europe- a worthless crew- mock us any more. It were indeed\\na monstrous thing if, after conquering and enslaving the Sacae, the\\nIndians, the Ethiopians, the Assyrians, and many other mighty nations,\\nnot for any wrong that they had done us, but only to increase our\\nempire, we should then allow the Greeks, who have done us such wanton\\ninjury, to escape our vengeance. What is it that we fear in them?-\\nnot surely their numbers?- not the greatness of their wealth? We know\\nthe manner of their battle- we know how weak their power is; already\\nhave we subdued their children who dwell in our country, the Ionians,\\nAeolians, and Dorians. I myself have had experience of these men when\\nI marched against them by the orders of thy father; and though I went\\nas far as Macedonia, and came but a little short of reaching Athens\\nitself, yet not a soul ventured to come out against me to battle.\\n(SS 2.) And yet, I am told, these very Greeks are wont to wage wars\\nagainst one another in the most foolish way, through sheer perversity\\nand doltishness. For no sooner is war proclaimed than they search\\nout the smoothest and fairest plain that is to be found in all the\\nland, and there they assemble and fight; whence it comes to pass that\\neven the conquerors depart with great loss: I say nothing of the conquered,\\nfor they are destroyed altogether. Now surely, as they are all of\\none speech, they ought to interchange heralds and messengers, and\\nmake up their differences by any means rather than battle; or, at\\nthe worst, if they must needs fight one against another, they ought\\nto post themselves as strongly as possible, and so try their quarrels.\\nBut, notwithstanding that they have so foolish a manner of warfare,\\nyet these Greeks, when I led my army against them to the very borders\\nof Macedonia, did not so much as think of offering me battle. (SS\\n3.) Who then will dare, O king! to meet thee in arms, when thou comest\\nwith all Asia\\'s warriors at thy back, and with all her ships? For\\nmy part I do not believe the Greek people will be so foolhardy. Grant,\\nhowever, that I am mistaken herein, and that they are foolish enough\\nto meet us in open fight; in that case they will learn that there\\nare no such soldiers in the whole world as we. Nevertheless let us\\nspare no pains; for nothing comes without trouble; but all that men\\nacquire is got by painstaking.\" \\n\\nWhen Mardonius had in this way softened the harsh speech of Xerxes,\\nhe too held his peace. \\n\\n(SS 1.) The other Persians were silent; all feared to raise their\\nvoice against the plan proposed to them. But Artabanus, the son of\\nHystaspes, and uncle of Xerxes, trusting to his relationship, was\\nbold to speak:- \"O king!\" he said, \"it is impossible, if no more than\\none opinion is uttered, to make choice of the best: a man is forced\\nthen to follow whatever advice may have been given him; but if opposite\\nspeeches are delivered, then choice can be exercised. In like manner\\npure gold is not recognised by itself; but when we test it along with\\nbaser ore, we perceive which is the better. I counselled thy father,\\nDarius, who was my own brother, not to attack the Scyths, a race of\\npeople who had no town in their whole land. He thought however to\\nsubdue those wandering tribes, and would not listen to me, but marched\\nan army against them, and ere he returned home lost many of his bravest\\nwarriors. Thou art about, O king! to attack a people far superior\\nto the Scyths, a people distinguished above others both by land and\\nsea. \\'Tis fit therefore that I should tell thee what danger thou incurrest\\nhereby. (SS 2.) Thou sayest that thou wilt bridge the Hellespont,\\nand lead thy troops through Europe against Greece. Now suppose some\\ndisaster befall thee by land or sea, or by both. It may be even so;\\nfor the men are reputed valiant. Indeed one may measure their prowess\\nfrom what they have already done; for when Datis and Artaphernes led\\ntheir huge army against Attica, the Athenians singly defeated them.\\nBut grant they are not successful on both elements. Still, if they\\nman their ships, and, defeating us by sea, sail to the Hellespont,\\nand there destroy our bridge- that, sire, were a fearful hazard. (SS\\n3.) And here \\'tis not by my own mother wit alone that I conjecture\\nwhat will happen; but I remember how narrowly we escaped disaster\\nonce, when thy father, after throwing bridges over the Thracian Bosphorus\\nand the Ister, marched against the Scythians, and they tried every\\nsort of prayer to induce the Ionians, who had charge of the bridge\\nover the Ister, to break the passage. On that day, if Histiaeus, the\\nking of Miletus, had sided with the other princes, and not set himself\\nto oppose their views, the empire of the Persians would have come\\nto nought. Surely a dreadful thing is this even to hear said, that\\nthe king\\'s fortunes depended wholly on one man. \\n\\n(SS 4.) \"Think then no more of incurring so great a danger when no\\nneed presses, but follow the advice I tender. Break up this meeting,\\nand when thou hast well considered the matter with thyself, and settled\\nwhat thou wilt do, declare to us thy resolve. I know not of aught\\nin the world that so profits a man as taking good counsel with himself;\\nfor even if things fall out against one\\'s hopes, still one has counselled\\nwell, though fortune has made the counsel of none effect: whereas\\nif a man counsels ill and luck follows, he has gotten a windfall,\\nbut his counsel is none the less silly. (SS 5.) Seest thou how God\\nwith his lightning smites always the bigger animals, and will not\\nsuffer them to wax insolent, while those of a lesser bulk chafe him\\nnot? How likewise his bolts fall ever on the highest houses and the\\ntallest trees? So plainly does He love to bring down everything that\\nexalts itself. Thus ofttimes a mighty host is discomfited by a few\\nmen, when God in his jealousy sends fear or storm from heaven, and\\nthey perish in a way unworthy of them. For God allows no one to have\\nhigh thoughts but Himself. (SS 6.) Again, hurry always brings about\\ndisasters, from which huge sufferings are wont to arise; but in delay\\nlie many advantages, not apparent (it may be) at first sight, but\\nsuch as in course of time are seen of all. Such then is my counsel\\nto thee, O king! \\n\\n(SS 7.) \"And thou, Mardonius, son of Gobryas, forbear to speak foolishly\\nconcerning the Greeks, who are men that ought not to be lightly esteemed\\nby us. For while thou revilest the Greeks, thou dost encourage the\\nking to lead his own troops against them; and this, as it seems to\\nme, is what thou art specially striving to accomplish. Heaven send\\nthou succeed not to thy wish! For slander is of all evils the most\\nterrible. In it two men do wrong, and one man has wrong done to him.\\nThe slanderer does wrong, forasmuch as he abuses a man behind his\\nback; and the hearer, forasmuch as he believes what he has not searched\\ninto thoroughly. The man slandered in his absence suffers wrong at\\nthe hands of both: for one brings against him a false charge; and\\nthe other thinks him an evildoer. (SS 8.) If, however, it must needs\\nbe that we go to war with this people, at least allow the king to\\nabide at home in Persia. Then let thee and me both stake our children\\non the issue, and do thou choose out thy men, and, taking with thee\\nwhatever number of troops thou likest, lead forth our armies to battle.\\nIf things go well for the king, as thou sayest they will, let me and\\nmy children be put to death; but if they fall out as I prophesy, let\\nthy children suffer, and thyself too, if thou shalt come back alive.\\nBut shouldest thou refuse this wager, and still resolve to march an\\narmy against Greece, sure I am that some of those whom thou leavest\\nbehind thee here will one day receive the sad tidings that Mardonius\\nhas brought a great disaster upon the Persian people, and lies a prey\\nto dogs and birds somewhere in the land of the Athenians, or else\\nin that of the Lacedaemonians; unless indeed thou shalt have perished\\nsooner by the way, experiencing in thy own person the might of those\\nmen on whom thou wouldest fain induce the king to make war.\"\\n\\nThus spake Artabanus. But Xerxes, full of wrath, replied to him:-\\n\\n\"Artabanus, thou art my father\\'s brother- that shall save thee from\\nreceiving the due meed of thy silly words. One shame however I will\\nlay upon thee, coward and faint-hearted as thou art- thou shalt not\\ncome with me to fight these Greeks, but shalt tarry here with the\\nwomen. Without thy aid I will accomplish all of which I spake. For\\nlet me not be thought the child of Darius, the son of Hystaspes, the\\nson of Arsames, the son of Ariaramnes, the son of Teispes, the son\\nof Cyrus, the son of Cambyses, the son of Teispes, the son of Achaemenes,\\nif I take not vengeance on the Athenians. Full well I know that, were\\nwe to remain at rest, yet would not they, but would most certainly\\ninvade our country, if at least it be right to judge from what they\\nhave already done; for, remember, it was they who fired Sardis and\\nattacked Asia. So now retreat is on both sides impossible, and the\\nchoice lies between doing and suffering injury; either our empire\\nmust pass under the dominion of the Greeks, or their land become the\\nprey of the Persians; for there is no middle course left in this quarrel.\\nIt is right then that we, who have in times past received wrong, should\\nnow avenge it, and that I should thereby discover what that great\\nrisk is which I run in marching against these men- men whom Pelops\\nthe Phrygian, a vassal of my forefathers, subdued so utterly, that\\nto this day both the land, and the people who dwell therein, alike\\nbear the name of the conqueror!\" \\n\\nThus far did the speaking proceed. Afterwards evening fell; and Xerxes\\nbegan to find the advice of Artabanus greatly disquiet him. So he\\nthought upon it during the night, and concluded at last that it was\\nnot for his advantage to lead an army into Greece. When he had thus\\nmade up his mind anew, he fell asleep. And now he saw in the night,\\nas the Persians declare, a vision of this nature- he thought a tall\\nand beautiful man stood over him and said, \"Hast thou then changed\\nthy mind, Persian, and wilt thou not lead forth thy host against the\\nGreeks, after commanding the Persians to gather together their levies?\\nBe sure thou doest not well to change; nor is there a man here who\\nwill approve thy conduct. The course that thou didst determine on\\nduring the day, let that be followed.\" After thus speaking the man\\nseemed to Xerxes to fly away. \\n\\nDay dawned; and the king made no account of this dream, but called\\ntogether the same Persians as before, and spake to them as follows:-\\n\\n\"Men of Persia, forgive me if I alter the resolve to which I came\\nso lately. Consider that I have not yet reached to the full growth\\nof my wisdom, and that they who urge me to engage in this war leave\\nme not to myself for a moment. When I heard the advice of Artabanus,\\nmy young blood suddenly boiled; and I spake words against him little\\nbefitting his years: now however I confess my fault, and am resolved\\nto follow his counsel. Understand then that I have changed my intent\\nwith respect to carrying war into Greece, and cease to trouble yourselves.\"\\n\\nWhen they heard these words, the Persians were full of joy, and, falling\\ndown at the feet of Xerxes, made obeisance to him. \\n\\nBut when night came, again the same vision stood over Xerxes as he\\nslept, and said, \"Son of Darius, it seems thou hast openly before\\nall the Persians renounced the expedition, making light of my words,\\nas though thou hadst not heard them spoken. Know therefore and be\\nwell assured, that unless thou go forth to the war, this thing shall\\nhappen unto thee thou art grown mighty and puissant in a short space,\\nso likewise shalt thou within a little time be brought low indeed.\"\\n\\nThen Xerxes, greatly frightened at the vision which he had seen, sprang\\nfrom his couch, and sent a messenger to call Artabanus, who came at\\nthe summons, when Xerxes spoke to him in these words:- \\n\\n\"Artabanus, at the moment I acted foolishly, when I gave thee ill\\nwords in return for thy good advice. However it was not long ere I\\nrepented, and was convinced that thy counsel was such as I ought to\\nfollow. But I may not now act in this way, greatly as I desire to\\ndo so. For ever since I repented and changed my mind a dream has haunted\\nme, which disapproves my intentions, and has now just gone from me\\nwith threats. Now if this dream is sent to me from God, and if it\\nis indeed his will that our troops should march against Greece, thou\\ntoo wilt have the same dream come to thee and receive the same commands\\nas myself. And this will be most sure to happen, I think, if thou\\nputtest on the dress which I am wont to wear, and then, after taking\\nthy seat upon my throne, liest down to sleep on my bed.\"\\n\\nSuch were the words of Xerxes. Artabanus would not at first yield\\nto the command of the king; for he deemed himself unworthy to sit\\nupon the royal throne. At the last however he was forced to give way,\\nand did as Xerxes bade him; but first he spake thus to the king (SS\\n1.):- \\n\\n\"To me, sire, it seems to matter little whether a man is wise himself\\nor willing to hearken to such as give good advice. In thee truly are\\nfound both but the counsels of evil men lead thee astray: they are\\nlike the gales of wind which vex the sea- else the most useful thing\\nfor man in the whole world- and suffer it not to follow the bent of\\nits own nature. For myself, it irked me not so much to be reproached\\nby thee, as to observe that when two courses were placed before the\\nPersian people, one of a nature to increase their pride, the other\\nto humble it, by showing them how hurtful it is to allow one\\'s heart\\nalways to covet more than one at present possesses, thou madest choice\\nof that which was the worse both for thyself and for the Persians.\\n(SS 2.) Now thou sayest that from the time when thou didst approve\\nthe better course, and give up the thought of warring against Greece,\\na dream has haunted thee, sent by some god or other, which will not\\nsuffer thee to lay aside the expedition. But such things, my son,\\nhave of a truth nothing divine in them. The dreams that wander to\\nand fro among mankind, I will tell thee of what nature they are- I\\nwho have seen so many more years than thou. Whatever a man has been\\nthinking of during the day is wont to hover round him in the visions\\nof his dreams at night. Now we during these many days past have had\\nour hands full of this enterprise. (SS 3.) If however the matter be\\nnot as I suppose, but God has indeed some part therein, thou hast\\nin brief declared the whole that can be said concerning it- let it\\ne\\'en appear to me as it has to thee, and lay on me the same injunctions.\\nBut it ought not to appear to me any the more if I put on thy clothes\\nthan if I wear my own, nor if I go to sleep in thy bed than if I do\\nso in mine- supposing, I mean, that it is about to appear at all.\\nFor this thing, be it what it may, that visits thee in thy sleep,\\nsurely is not so far gone in folly as to see me, and because I am\\ndressed in thy clothes, straightway to mistake me for thee. Now however\\nour business is to see if it will regard me as of small account, and\\nnot vouchsafe to appear to me, whether I wear mine own clothes or\\nthine, while it keeps on haunting thee continually. If it does so,\\nand appears often, I should myself say that it was from God. For the\\nrest, if thy mind is fixed, and it is not possible to turn thee from\\nthy design, but I must needs go and sleep in thy bed, well and good,\\nlet it be even so; and when I have done as thou wishest, then let\\nthe dream appear to me. Till such time, however, I shall keep to my\\nformer opinion.\" \\n\\nThus spake Artabanus; and when he had so said, thinking to show Xerxes\\nthat his words were nought, he did according to his orders. Having\\nput on the garments which Xerxes was wont to wear and taken his seat\\nupon the royal throne, he lay down to sleep upon the king\\'s own bed.\\nAs he slept, there appeared to him the very same dream which had been\\nseen by Xerxes; it came and stood over Artabanus, and said:-\\n\\n\"Thou art the man, then, who, feigning to be tender of Xerxes, seekest\\nto dissuade him from leading his armies against the Greeks! But thou\\nshalt not escape scathless, either now or in time to come, because\\nthou hast sought to prevent that which is fated to happen. As for\\nXerxes, it has been plainly told to himself what will befall him,\\nif he refuses to perform my bidding.\" \\n\\nIn such words, as Artabanus thought, the vision threatened him, and\\nthen endeavoured to burn out his eyes with red-hot irons. At this\\nhe shrieked, and, leaping from his couch, hurried to Xerxes, and,\\nsitting down at his side, gave him a full account of the vision; after\\nwhich he went on to speak in the words which follow:- \\n\\n\"I, O King! am a man who have seen many mighty empires overthrown\\nby weaker ones; and therefore it was that I sought to hinder thee\\nfrom being quite carried away by thy youth; since I knew how evil\\na thing it is to covet more than one possesses. I could remember the\\nexpedition of Cyrus against the Massagetae, and what was the issue\\nof it; I could recollect the march of Cambyses against the Ethiops;\\nI had taken part in the attack of Darius upon the Scyths-bearing therefore\\nall these things in mind, I thought with myself that if thou shouldst\\nremain at peace, all men would deem thee fortunate. But as this impulse\\nhas plainly come from above, and a heaven-sent destruction seems about\\nto overtake the Greeks, behold, I change to another mind, and alter\\nmy thoughts upon the matter. Do thou therefore make known to the Persians\\nwhat the god has declared, and bid them follow the orders which were\\nfirst given, and prepare their levies. Be careful to act so that the\\nbounty of the god may not be hindered by slackness on thy part.\"\\n\\nThus spake these two together; and Xerxes, being in good heart on\\naccount of the vision, when day broke, laid all before the Persians;\\nwhile Artabanus, who had formerly been the only person openly to oppose\\nthe expedition, now showed as openly that he favoured it.\\n\\nAfter Xerxes had thus determined to go forth to the war, there appeared\\nto him in his sleep yet a third vision. The Magi were consulted upon\\nit, and said that its meaning reached to the whole earth, and that\\nall mankind would become his servants. Now the vision which the king\\nsaw was this: he dreamt that he was crowned with a branch of an olive\\ntree, and that boughs spread out from the olive branch and covered\\nthe whole earth; then suddenly the garland, as it lay upon his brow,\\nvanished. So when the Magi had thus interpreted the vision, straightway\\nall the Persians who were come together departed to t\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n"
